Mit einem Autosimulator (vgl. https://evsim.gonium.net) kann man auf vielen Parkpl\u00e4tzen Strom beziehen, zum Beispiel um Waffeln zu backen:\r\n\r\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pUEp3uWAWqY\r\n\r\nMit diesem Simulator habe ich mir verschiedene Lades\u00e4ulen sowie ihre Backend-Kommunikation angeschaut. An den meisten Lades\u00e4ulen im \u00f6ffentlichen Raum weist man sich mittels NFC-Chipkarte aus. \u00dcber das \u201cOpen Charge Point Protocol\u201d (OCPP)  (vgl. http://www.openchargealliance.org/protocols/ocpp/ocpp-15/) redet die Lades\u00e4ule dann mit einem Backend und pr\u00fcft, ob der Ladevorgang freigeschaltet werden darf. Leider weisen sowohl die verwendeten Chipkarte als auch das OCPP-Protokoll selbst gravierende M\u00e4ngel auf:\r\n\r\nEs ist mit geringen Aufwand m\u00f6glich, auf fremde Kosten zu laden.\r\nB\u00f6swillige Lades\u00e4ulenbetreiber k\u00f6nnten Ladevorg\u00e4nge protokollieren und sp\u00e4ter \u201cvirtuelle\u201d Ladevorg\u00e4nge simulieren, um zus\u00e4tzlichen Umsatz zu generieren.\r\n\r\nLades\u00e4ulen sind teilweise \u00fcber das Internet erreichbar und k\u00f6nnen ferngesteuert werden: Ein laufender Ladevorgang kann aus der Ferne abgebrochen werden.\r\n\r\nWer physischen Zugriff auf Ladestationen hat kann diese beliebig umkonfigurieren und so z.B. alle Informationen f\u00fcr das Klonen von Ladekarten abschnorcheln. Der Vortrag stellt die Funktionsweise der Abrechnungssysteme dar und zeigt Proof of Concept-Implementationen verschiedener Angriffe.",

The SCS will rate online and offline behavior to create a score for each user. One of them is planned to become mandatory in 2020. This lecture will review the current state of governmental and private SCS and different aspects of these systems.", 
                                "description": "Imagine living in a society where your actions will be rated and formed into a score. Where your online or offline behavior, work performance and attitude towards littering or ignoring red lights will be included in it. And that score will define your job, your ability to get a loan, your general chances, and your life. But don't be scared, it won't be like Orwell's frightening Big Brother. It will be like an all-embracing game, a huge MMORPG. You can do tasks to better your score.\r\nWhat sounds like dystopian fiction or just a teaser for a \u201cBlack Mirror\u201d episode became a real life option in 2014, when China's Communist Party (CP) published a \u201cPlanning Outline for the Construction of a Social Credit System (2014-2020)\u201d. The CP announced the system to be mandatory for every Chinese person in 2020. It is no theoretical babbling about something happening in a far future: The CP started experimenting with such social credit systems (SCS) in different regions soon after, allowed the private development of such systems, and was cited to become world leader of SCS. While the official goal of the SCS is to level economic development and to bring harmony, sincerity and trust to the whole country, the question is what the \u201cside effects\u201d might be.\r\n\r\nStarting with a review of the current state of social credit systems (SCS) in China, examples of their functions and examples of consequences of their existence will be provided. This information will be embedded into a short walk through the People's Republic's Internet landscape, its big players like the BAT (Baidu, Alibaba, and Tencent), and the CP's digital policies. In the following this will be set it in relation to current ideological turns and the CP's announcement to become the world leader in SCS. \r\nChina's SCS is seen as an extreme example of a tendency that has developed in most industrialized countries. It displays what can be drawn from the huge amount of information provided by ICTs and so-called \u201csocial media\u201d. And it can show possible consequences of the combination of big data and nearly endless storage on one hand and evaluation by algorithms on the other. From the point of view that this aspect of digitalization is not a problem of the Chinese but for all of us, it will lead to the question how critical thinking and dissenting actions can develop in a reality that is constantly rating behavior to create a score that is defining vast parts of your life. Ending in a discussion on possibilities of big data based social rating and social control and modes of resistance.",

Where are the studies and reports on software content and safety, so that consumers can minimize their risk and make informed choices about what software is worth the risk it adds to an environment?  We at CITL are working to fill in these blind spots, so that security professionals can back up their recommendations with solid scientific findings, and consumers can be empowered to better protect themselves.  We'll be talking about the automated static analysis and fuzzing frameworks we're developing and presenting early results from our large scale software testing efforts.",

Um diese Sichtweise zu korrigieren, haben wir das Programm Nomorp entwickelt, das in der Lage ist, zentrale Sicherungs- und H\u00e4rtungsma\u00dfnahmen in weltweit 31 Apps vollautomatisch zu deaktivieren und somit Schadsoftware T\u00fcr und Tor \u00f6ffnet.

Sich der konzeptionellen Angreifbarkeit der Verfahren bewusst, suchen die Banken ihre Apps durch Speziall\u00f6sungen Dritter abzusichern. Diese Produkte sind mittlerweile zum integralen Bestandteil vieler Banking-Apps geworden und sollen deren Sicherheit im Falle eines kompromittierten Ger\u00e4ts garantieren. \r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nIm Finanzbereich allgemein, gerade aber im Feld der deutschen Banking-Apps, ist das sog. <em>Promon SHIELD</em> des norwegischen Herstellers <em>Promon</em> eine bekannte Sicherheitsl\u00f6sung, die durch ihre hohe Beliebtheit bei allen Instituten der deutschen Bankenlandschaft besticht. Insbesondere bei den Apps der Sparkassen-Finanzgruppe und den Volksbanken-Raiffeisenbanken ist das <em>Promon SHIELD</em> mittlerweile zum Dreh- und Angelpunkt der Sicherheitsarchitektur geworden. Als solches findet es sich nicht nur in deren Banking- und pushTAN-Apps, sondern auch in zehn weiteren Apps wieder. Aber auch bei den Privatbanken ist das Produkt gesch\u00e4tzt und wird unter anderem von der Commerzbank oder auch der Fidor Bank eingesetzt. Auch das Bayerische Landesamt f\u00fcr Finanzen, seines Zeichens verantwortlich f\u00fcr <em>Elster</em>, setzt auf <em>Promon</em>.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nMit <em>Nomorp</em> haben wir ein Werkzeug geschaffen, das die durch das <em>Promon SHIELD</em> eingef\u00fchrten Sicherungs- und H\u00e4rtungsma\u00dfnahmen in weltweit 31 Finanz-Apps vollst\u00e4ndig deaktivieren und zum Teil sogar umkehren kann. <em>Nomorp</em> arbeitet dabei vollautomatisch, ger\u00e4te- und versionsunabh\u00e4ngig. Seine Anwendung f\u00fchrt oft dazu, dass neben klassischer App-H\u00e4rtung auch etablierte Best Practices wie Zertifikats-Pinning oder auch das verschl\u00fcsselte Ablegen von sensiblen Kundendaten nicht mehr existieren. Obwohl der Fokus auf dem Marktf\u00fchrer Android liegt, wird der Vortrag ebenfalls zeigen, dass sich entscheidende Teile des Angriffs auf die entsprechenden iOS-Apps \u00fcbertragen lassen.\r\n</p>\r\n",

These attacks abuse features of a protocol to reinstall an already in-use key, thereby resetting nonces and/or replay counters associated to this key. We show that our novel attack technique breaks several handshakes that are used in a WPA2-protected network.", 
                                "description": "All protected Wi-Fi networks use the 4-way handshake to generate fresh session keys. The design of this handshake was proven secure, and over its 14-year lifetime no weaknesses have been found in it. However, contrary to this history, we show that the 4-way handshake is vulnerable to key reinstallation attacks. In such an attack, the adversary tricks a victim into reinstalling an already in-use key. This is achieved by manipulating and replaying handshake messages. When the victim reinstalls the key, the associated incremental nonce and replay counter is reset to its initial value. Apart from breaking the 4-way handshake, we also show that our key reinstallation attack breaks the group key and Fast BSS Transition (FT) handshake. The impact of our attacks depend on both the handshake being targeted, and the data-confidentiality protocol in use. Simplified, against AES-CCMP, an adversary can replay and decrypt packets, but cannot forge packets. Still, this makes it possible to hijack TCP streams and inject malicious data into them. Against WPA-TKIP and GCMP, the impact is catastrophic: an adversary can replay, decrypt, and forge arbitrary packets. Rather surprisingly, GCMP is especially affected because it uses the same authentication key in both communication directions.\r\n\r\nFinally, we confirmed our findings in practice, and found that every Wi-Fi device is vulnerable to some variant of our attacks. Notably, our attack is exceptionally devastating against Android and Linux: it forces the client into using a predictable all-zero encryption key.",

In diesem Talk gehen wir auf verschiedene Beispiele ein und erkl\u00e4ren, wie CADUS mit seinem Makerspace versucht, dieses Problem auf vielen Ebenen zu hacken.", 
                                "description": "Die NGO CADUS steht mit ihrer Arbeit praktisch t\u00e4glich vor der Problemlage, dass die Gesundheit als entscheidender Teil von Gl\u00fcck und Zufriedenheit bis in ihre kleinsten Teilbereiche \u201edurchkapitalisiert\u201c ist. Das hei\u00dft, dass beispielsweise technische Ger\u00e4tschaften, deren Technik an und f\u00fcr sich eher einfach ist und die auf Erkenntnissen basiert, die nicht mehr die Neuesten und l\u00e4ngst nicht mehr als revolution\u00e4r zu bezeichnen sind, extrem teuer sind. \r\nF\u00fcr viele ist diese Tatsache ganz \u201enormal\u201c. Das ist sie aber nur, weil einerseits der \u201eMythos\u201c der ultra teuren medizinischen Technologie weiter flei\u00dfig von den beteiligten Unternehmen gen\u00e4hrt wird und andererseits diese produzierenden Unternehmen den Markt praktisch global kontrollieren. \r\n\r\nDar\u00fcber hinaus sitzen diese medizintechnisch produzierenden Firmen h\u00e4ufig selbst in den entscheidenden Kommissionen und Gremien und k\u00f6nnen so \u00fcber die Marktentwicklung, etwaige Grenzwerte, Abgabezahlen und somit letztlich auch die Preisentwicklung (mit)bestimmen. \r\n\r\nDieses praktisch kartellierte oder zumindest dem erh\u00e4rteten Lobbyismusverdacht unterliegende Vorgehen missf\u00e4llt uns deutlich. G\u00fcnstigere L\u00f6sungen f\u00fcr bspw. Vitalparametermonitoring k\u00f6nnen dementsprechend somit gar nicht erst produziert werden und auf den Markt kommen. \r\n\r\nEin weiteres Beispiel f\u00fcr vornehmlich kapitalistisch-geleitete Zust\u00e4nde in den Bereichen Gesundheit, Versorgung und Krisenintervention, die haupts\u00e4chlich durch Lobbyismus, kontrollierte Marktzug\u00e4nge und maximal gewinnorientiertes Interesse einiger Weniger bestimmt werden, konnte erst k\u00fcrzlich bei der Krisenversorgung nach dem Hurrikan, der weite Teile der Gesellschaft und des Lebens auf Puerto Rico lahmlegte, beobachtet werden. \r\nDen Hafen von Puerto Rico d\u00fcrfen nur Schiffe unter amerikanischer Flagge anfahren, eine rein wirtschaftsrelevante Regelung. Nach dem Hurrikan kamen durch diese Regelung tagelang weder Wasser, Treibstoff noch andere Hilfslieferungen an, und die  Bev\u00f6lkerung wurde sinnlos weiterem Leid ausgesetzt. \r\n\r\nGanz \u00e4hnlich wie das Beispiel der Erstversorgung der Puerto Ricaner*innen nach dem Hurrikan ist auch das dritte Beispiel gelagert: Der Luftraum \u00fcber dem Mittelmeer ist einerseits der weltweit am besten \u00fcberwachte Luftraum; andererseits sehen wir seit Jahren keine Verbesserung in der Seenotrettung Gefl\u00fcchteter. Im Gegenteil \u2013 die Lage spitzt sich immer weiter zu, und immer wieder geraten Boote mit hunderten Menschen darauf in Seenot und unz\u00e4hlige Menschen sterben. \r\n\r\nDrei Beispiele, drei L\u00f6sungsans\u00e4tze, wie CADUS und andere Organisationen wie Sea Watch und die HPI Hardware, Dienstleistungen und Informationsfl\u00fcsse hacken, um Krisenintervention und Basisgesundheitsdienstleistungen f\u00fcr alle Menschen m\u00f6glich zu machen. \r\nIm CADUS-Makerspace in Berlin wird an diversen L\u00f6sungen bereits gebastelt. Der Talk dient nicht nur zur Information und zum Anregen von Diskussionen, sondern ist auch ein konkreter Aufruf zur aktiven Teilhabe.  \r\n",

                                "description": "Packet processing in software is currently undergoing a huge paradigm shift.\r\nConnection speeds of 10 Gbit/s and above created new problems and operating systems couldn't keep keep up.\r\nHence, there has been a rise of frameworks and libraries working around the kernel, sometimes referred to as kernel bypass or zero copy (the latter is a misnomer). Examples are DPDK, Snabb, netmap, XDP, pf_ring, and pfq.\r\nThese new frameworks break with all traditional APIs and present new paradigms.\r\nFor example, they usually provide an application exclusive access to a network interface and exchange raw packets with the app.\r\nThere are no sockets, they don't even offer a protocol stack.\r\nHence, they are mostly used for low-level packet processing apps: routers, (virtual) switches, firewalls, and annoying middleboxes \"optimizing\" your connection.\r\nThese frameworks have already changed how network research is done in academia by shifting the focus from hardware to software.\r\nIt's now feasible to write quick prototypes of packet processing and forwarding apps that were restricted to dedicated hardware in the past, enabling everyone to build and test high-speed networking equipment with a low budget.\r\n\r\nThese concepts are slowly creeping into operating systems: FreeBSD ships with netmap today, XDP is coming to Linux, Open vSwitch can be compiled with a DPDK backend, pfSense is adopting DPDK as well, ...\r\nWe need to look at the architecture of all of these frameworks to better understand what is coming for us.\r\nMost of these frameworks build on the original drivers that have been growing in complexity: a typical driver for a 10 or 40 Gbit/s NIC is in the order of 50,000 lines of code nowadays.\r\nThis is why it's important to have a simple driver like <a href=\"https://github.com/emmericp/ixy\">ixy</a>: for hacking and educational purposes.\r\nCore functionality of the driver, like handling DMA buffers, is never far away when writing an ixy app: you typically only need to look beneath one layer to see the guts of the driver. For example, when you send out a packet you call a transmit function that directly modifies a ring buffer of DMA descriptors.\r\n\r\nixy is a full userspace driver: you get your raw packets delivered directly into your application and the operating system doesn't even know the NIC exists.\r\nUserspace drivers are also very hackable, you get direct access to the full hardware in your application in userspace making it really easy to test out new features, no pesky kernel code needed.\r\n\r\n\r\nCheck out the code of <a href=\"https://github.com/emmericp/ixy\">ixy on GitHub</a>!\r\n\r\n",

Later that year, I was arrested (and banned from the Internet) for my involvement in LulzSec. Then, in 2014, I discovered through a new Snowden leak[1] that GCHQ had targeted Anonymous and LulzSec, and the person that messaged me was a covert GCHQ employee, pretending to be a hacktivist.\r\n\r\nBecause I was myself targeted in the past, I was aware of a key detail, a honeypot URL shortening service setup by GCHQ, that was actually redacted in the Snowden documents published in 2014. This URL shortening service enabled GCHQ to deanonymize another hacktivist and discover his real name and Facebook account, according to the leaked document.\r\n\r\nUsing this key detail, I was able to discover a network of sockpuppet Twitter accounts and websites setup by GCHQ, pretending to be activists during the Arab spring of 2011 and Iranian revolution of 2009, and we published an article about it last summer in Motherboard as a piece of investigative journalism.\r\n\r\nThis talk will:\r\n- go into detail about how and why GCHQ setup a network of fake social media accounts, blogs, honeypot proxies and news sites during revolutionary events;\r\n- reveal new details about other fake websites that GCHQ setup in other parts of the world for different purposes.\r\n\r\nThe people responsible, the Joint Threat Research Intelligence Group (JTRIG), is a group within GCHQ that has the aim of \"using online techniques to make something happen in the real or cyber world\". To fulfill this aim, a wide but basic array of technological tools and software are used at JTRIG\u2019s disposal, as detailed in the published document titled \"JTRIG tools and techniques\"[2]. These tools include \"DEADPOOL\", described as a \"URL shortening service\", and \"HUSK\", a \"secure one-to-one web based dead-drop messaging platform\".\r\n\r\nHow can seemingly innocent web services be used as honeypots to conduct signal intelligence, being part of something more sinister?",

Two key questions to ask are: Are the specifications of the Trusted Computing Base correct? And do the implementations match the specifications? I will explore the philosophical challenges and practical steps you can take in answering that question for one of the major dependencies: the hardware your software runs on. I will describe the combination of formal verification and testing that ARM uses to verify the processor specification and I will talk about our current challenge: getting the specification down to zero bugs while the architecture continues to evolve.",

Why a vacuum cleaning robot needs tcpdump?\r\nNowadays IoT devices are getting more and more powerful and contain a lot of sensors. As most devices are connected directly to the vendor and transmit all data encrypted to the cloud, this may result in privacy issues. An IoT device with no internet connection lacks numerous features or is even unusable. We want to change that.\r\n\r\nWe show you how to root a Xiaomi vacuum cleaning robot in order to get access to the underlying Linux operating system. Furthermore, we will have a look into the vendors cloud interface and its commands, and will show you how to de-attach the device from the cloud and connect it to your local Smart Home system. Finally, we will demonstrate how to run Smart Home software directly on the vacuum cleaning robot itself.",

We will also publish a non-invasive method to get root access to your vacuum robot. \r\n\r\nAfter talking about the rooting procedure, we will discuss the internals of the robot. For example, the robot uses a so called SLAM (Simultaneous Localization and Mapping) system with LIDAR (Light Detection And Ranging) and various other sensors to create maps of your apartment. These maps are used, among other things, to calculate the best cleaning path. We will show you what these maps look like and how they are stored in the robot. At the end, we will discuss which data are created and uploaded to the vendor, and why this may be a big privacy issue. We will also prove why it is a bad idea to leave IoT devices in an unconfigured state.\r\n\r\nWe conclude with an overview of other interesting Smart Home devices from the vendor.",

The PCH carries communication between the processor and external devices; therefore, Intel ME has access to some critical data on the computer, and the ability to execute third-party code allows compromising the platform completely.\r\nResearchers have been long interested in such capabilities, but recently we have seen a surge of interest in Intel ME. \r\nIntel provides its engineers with the ability to perform ME debugging via JTAG, in addition to allowing third-party developers to debug ISH via DCI (as previously discussed by us at 33\u04413). Anyone could use the vulnerability we have found to activate JTAG debugging for ME.

With the AfD in parliament far-right illiberalism has reached the mainstream. We investigate the communicative developments underlying this rise. Using web-scraping and automated content analysis, we collected over 10.000 articles from mainstream-news and far-right blogs, along with over 90GBs of Tweets and thousands of Facebook-Posts. This allows us a deep insight into how public discourse works in 2017 Germany.", 
                                "description": "The Bundestagswahl 2017 was an earthquake to Germany's political landscape. With the AfD an illiberal and openly xenophobic party became the third-largest force in parliament. Its rise over just four years is unlike anything seen in Germany before. \r\nThe new media landscape has often been touted as a key component of the rise of the AfD. More than any other party the AfD has made frequent use of the \"populist playbook\" -- stirring controversy through inflammatory rhetoric before back-pedalling and slamming  the \"L\u00fcgenpresse\" (mendacious press). More than this, though, no other party has been as successful in directly connecting to and communicating with followers on Facebook to spread their \"real\" messaging outside mainstream media channels. Likewise, the proliferation of distinctly right-wing, rabble-rousing \"news\"-blogs and spread of these \"news\" on social media have given the far right an unfiltered platform to communicate with supporters. This has fundamentally shaken what scholars know about mass communication and agenda setting processes during elections.\r\nStill, despite many analyses and investigations we do not really know what actually went on during the 2017 campaign in Germany. Lots of attention has been devoted to the question if the AfD received too much space for presenting itself vis-a-vis the other parties in mainstream and social media channels. Yet, to our knowledge, no systematic investigation of these dynamics has been undertaken in Germany. We attempt here to undertake this investigation.\r\nStarting in early July of 2017 we used Python-based automated web scraping to access eight German-language \"news\"-blogs popular within networks of the extreme political right. Between July and September we collected almost 4500 articles from these right-leaning sites. In addition, using the Facebook-Graph-API we collected the shares and likes of each post from the Facebook-presences of those same blogs (where available). Simultaneously, we also collected mainstream media content. Using the Factiva and Lexis-Nexis news databases, we downloaded and parsed almost 6000 texts from both print as well as online media for the same period of time. Finally, to help capture public sentiment during the campaign, we collected all German tweets from Mid-August onward (roughly 90 GBs of data) alongside Google search trends data.\r\nThe texts from these three ecosystems - right-wing fringe blogs, mainstream media, and public internet search and sentiment data - serve as data to use automated content analysis, build topic and machine learning models, and run time series cross sectional analyses to understand the possible relationships between and within each area. This allows us to understand the co-integrated processes between media/public spheres and identify what was talked about, when it was talked about, and how it was talked about.\r\nOverall these data allow us to paint picture of campaign discourse in Germany. We can present answers to a number of questions: Did the AfD actually receive a disproportionate amount of attention? Do these separate media ecosystems influence one another? Who leads, who follows? How do political elites interact with the public via old and new media? Who is driving topics? Overall, this project presents a snapshot of the campaigning season for Germany in the year 2017. We unveil the dynamics brought about by new forms of public discourse.\r\n\r\n============\r\nAbout the researchers who collected and analysed this data:\r\nAlexander Beyer initially attended Eberhard-Karls-University in T\u00fcbingen, and is now a PhD-student at <A HREF=\"http://www.sfu.ca/politics.html\">Simon-Fraser-University</A>in Vancouver.

This talk provides an overview of these attacks as they have been applied to TEEs, and it additionally demonstrates how to mount these attacks on common TrustZone implementations. Finally, we identify new techniques which allow us to peer within TrustZone TEEs with greater resolution than ever before.", 
                                "description": "The goals of this talk are twofold. First, it will build up an understanding of microarchitectural attacks, Trusted Execution Environments, and the existing research into the two. The talk assumes only basic knowledge of processor operation, and presents the information needed to understand the many variants of attacks against the cache and more. We will also cover key similarities and differences between ARM TrustZone and Intel SGX technologies and how these can be abused by microarchitectural attacks. This is a relatively new field of research, but it is growing quickly, and we hope to explain the significant contributions and accomplishments that have been achieved already.\r\n\r\nThe second goal of the talk is to demonstrate how to perform these attacks in practice. We will take the TrustZone-based TEE implementation on the Nexus 5X as an example and explain how to write software which performs these side-channel attacks. We then push beyond the existing research and develop new methods to perform attacks on ARM TrustZone with greater precision than seen before. Our setup is relatively easy to implement, and we aim for this demonstration to encourage and enable further research into the software running within these trusted environments.\r\n\r\nBy the end of the talk, the audience will recognize the risks presented by microarchitectural attacks and the ease with which issues can be exploited. We hope to leave the audience appreciating the tension between processor security and performance and understanding the difficulty of truly securing a Trusted Execution Environment from this powerful class of attack.",

                                "description": "The AGC was an early digital computer specifically designed for the Apollo moon missions. The Command Module and the Lunar Module each contained one AGC. First built in 1965 from 5600 integrated circuits, it was one of the first minicomputers, beating commercial machines like the PDP-8 in weight (32 kg) and power consumption (55 W). The Apollo program's size and weight limitations as well as the requirements for real-time guidance, navigation and control were pushing 1960s technologies to their limits. As a 15 bit one's complement big-endian accumulator machine with 36 kilo-words of ROM and 2 kilo-words of RAM, its design seems very foreign from today's perspective. The operating system was real-time, priority-based cooperative/preemptive and fault-tolerant, supporting interpreted virtual machines \u2013 practically inventing many of these concepts.\r\n\r\nThis talk explains all the hardware details of the AGC: Its machine language, counters, timers, I/O, display and keyboard, as well as its implementation using integrated circuits, core memory and \"core rope\" ROM. The talk goes on to explain the software: interrupt handling, the core set, the wait list, the alarm system, the interpreter, and the actual user software, providing, among other things, guidance, navigation and control (GNC) services.\r\n\r\nThe audience will get a good understanding of hardware and software design in the 1960s, and appreciate the innovations driven by the Apollo program.",

(The ISA specification used in riscv-formal is itself formally verified against Spike , the official RISC-V simulator and \"golden reference\" implementation.) riscv-formal can be made to work with any existing processor design, all that is needed is to add an additional RVFI (RISC-V formal interface) trace port to the core.\r\n\r\nriscv-formal by default uses the open source SymbiYosys toolchain to perform the formal proofs, but it should be compatible with all major HDL formal verification flows.\r\n\r\nIn this presentation I will discuss how the complex task of verifying a processor against the ISA specification is broken down into smaller verification problems in riscv-formal, how to implement RVFI, how integrate a core with riscv-formal, and what kind of bugs can be detected using our method.\r\n\r\nMost of the proofs performed by riscv-formal are bounded proofs, i.e. it is only proven that the properties hold for the first N cycles after reset. But with a sufficiently large N we can create high confidence that in fact all relevant states can be reached within the bound of the proof and that therefore the bounded case is a sufficient proxy for the more general unbounded case. Abstractions, cut-points, and blackboxing can further help extend the effective bound of the proof. The presentation also touches on those techniques.",

                                "description": "Contrary to popular opinion, the worst security legislation is not always coming from right-wing governments like Poland or Hungary but also from the 'social' democracies of liberal markets strengthening their supremacy by striving for authoritarian power.\r\nFrance is part of the top countries trying to destroy encryption, especially through backdoor obligations. \r\nDespite advices of all digital security experts, French officials are still speaking out against encryption, systematically using the fight against terrorism as a pretext.\r\nAs a result, French law considers people using encryption as guiltier than others, imposing heavier penalties on people using it or regarding them as general suspects. Legislators also aim at obliging firms to hand over the uncrypted version of a communication or even the encryption key if possible. The period for data retention of encrypted communication is much longer than for non encrypted communications.\r\nAfter giving a brief historical summary of the french anti-crypto legislation, this talk will issue the possibilities to oppose this trend. Especially enquiring about what political role developers could play, this should definitely be understood as a call for action.",

Pharmaceutical companies are constantly under attack for questionable research methods. The scientist John Ioannidis asked more than ten years ago \"Why most scientific research findings are false\".\r\n\r\nThese aren't just single incidents, they show much deeper problems in the way science is performed today. Scientific results get published if they yield to \"positive\" results and land in the drawer if the results are \"negative\", giving an incomplete and often skewed picture. In many fields scientific studies are never replicated. Scientific incentive structures like the Impact Factor prefer sensational results more than rigorous scientific standards.\r\n\r\nBut there's also some move into the right direction. Trials registers or registered reports can prevent or at least detect many questionable research practices. The replication crisis has led some fields to put more emphasis on repetitions of important results.\r\n\r\nAppart from the fact that we get a wrong picture of reality these shortcomings of science also are undeserved munition for those who'd like to reject the scientific principle as a whole.\r\n\r\nHow broken is science - and what can be done to make more scientific results true?",

The modelling decisions underlying this data-driven algorithmic science evaluation are, among other things, the outcome of a specific power structure in the science system. Power relations are especially visible, when negotiated during processes of boundary work. Therefore, we use the discourse on 'citation cartels', to shed light on a specific perception of fairness in the scientific system, as well as on the actors who are in charge. While doing so, we draw analogies to the discourse on search engine optimization.", 
                                "description": "Scientific evaluation as governance technique is conducted through different instruments which have intended and unintended effects. One aspect of evaluation is the measurement of research quality through the performance of scientific publications, for example, how often they are cited. The design of such performance indicators is one core task of bibliometrics as a discipline.\r\n\r\nThere is incidence that citation-based performance indicators might have side effects on citation behaviour. Those effects have to be considered by the bibliometrics community. On the one hand, they have to be considered with regard to indicator design aiming at achieving validity of measurement. On the other hand, and maybe more important, they have to be considered with regard to indicator use and its effect on science and society.\r\n\r\nWe find some of this behavioural adaptation analogously in the development of search engine optimization (SEO). Search engine rankings share one core principle with citation-based indicators: that relevance (quality) is understood to be measurable through incoming links (citations) to a website (publication). The discourse on SEO and which strategies are to be regarded as white hat SEO or black hat SEO led to a more or less stable set of 'allowed' activities, which are approved by the search engine monopolist Google.\r\n\r\nCitation-based performance indicators are also the aim of optimization activities. One activity, which is believed to be undertaken by scientific journals, is the establishment of 'citation cartels' (groups of journals, which agree on mutually citing each other to boost their indicators). This form of strategic citation is widely regarded as morally corrupt. Beyond this specific type, there is an ongoing debate, which citation strategies are to be regarded scientific misconduct, and therefore threatening the 'fairness' of performance indicators.\r\n\r\nIn our talk, we will outline the discourse on strategic citation with examples, which show concerns or label some strategies as unethical, and some which demand detection and punishment of questionable behaviour. We especially point out that the request to embank strategic citation is often addressed to the publication database provider Thomson Reuters. Proceeding from this point, this opens up a new perspective on power structures in the science system.",

This talk documents the reverse engineering process of evasi0n7's main kernel exploit, which was performed in order to not only understand the underlying vulnerability, but more importantly to document the exploitation techniques the evad3rs have utilized. The talk will initially focus on the kernel debugging setup (a very important but often ignored step in device/embedded exploitation talks), the encountered problems and how they were overcome. I will then explain the underlying vulnerability, and the reverse engineering of the implemented exploitation techniques. Finally, I will present a detailed step by-step re-implementation of the kernel exploit.",

The vast amount of data these Earth observations systems collect enters the public discourse reduced to a few numbers, numbers like 3 or even 300. So, how do we know the amount of ice melting in the arctic or how much rain is falling in the Amazon? Are groundwater aquifers stable or are they are being depleted? Are these regular seasonal changes or is there a trend? How can we even measure these phenomena on a global scale?\r\n\r\nThis talk will provide one possible answer: gravity.", 
                                "description": "The melting of ice during the summer and the regrowth of ice shields in winter or any variation of mass on the surface of the Earth and inside the Earth, in general, are reflected in the change of its gravity field. By monitoring the gravity field from space, we can infer the mass variations necessary to result in the measured gravity changes. Satellite missions like GRACE (Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment) offer us a monthly view of the Earth's changing gravity field since 2002. Providing a look into the mass redistribution driven geophysical processes, climate, and human civilisation. Furthermore, the combination of gravity with additional types of measurements allows us to get a better understanding of our planet.  \r\nThe objective of this presentation is not to discuss the last significant decimal in some indicator of climate change. A look at the gravity field offers much more information, e. g., continental and global hydrology, changing ocean currents, mass flow in the mantle. This talk will give a brief introduction into space geodetic techniques used to monitor the gravity field of the Earth with a focus on the GRACE mission, its scientific results and applications. I will explain their working principle and the process which leads to a mathematical representation of the gravity field. We will look at a few selected examples, and try to answer the questions as mentioned above. Fortunately, the necessary data products are freely available. Additionally, there are services which spare us the math and offer tools to generate visualisations for a straightforward approach to this topic.",

A better healthcare for the future would include affordable high resolution body scans for everyone, which caused no harm to the body and enable us to track changes through machine learning algorithms. \r\n\r\nElectrical Impedance Tomography is an electrical current mapping technique enabling the reconstruction of 2D slices of the human body that is both non-invasive and completely safe (non-ionizing). It\u2019s an exciting and active area of research with new techniques coming out all the time to reach higher resolution imaging. The range of applications are huge and include measuring lung volume, muscle and fat mass, gestural recognition based on muscle movement, bladder or stomach fullness, breast and kidney cancer, hemorrhage detection and even monitoring the depth of anesthesia in patients. I\u2019ll talk about the state of research on each of these applications. \r\n\r\nCurrently there is no readily available platform to enable rapid development and collaboration in this area. Unfortunately this means very few people outside of biomedical engineering R&D have been able to experiment with it. This talk presents a new system in development that enables real-time electrical impedance tomography experimentation. I will present the hardware, python test bench and explanation of how the reconstruction algorithms work, then move to potential future directions and applications of this project. \r\n\r\nDemocratizing novel sensing technology opens the way to better collaborations and faster innovation to increase human healthspan.\r\n",

Websites are blocked on a large scale and many activists are sent to jail on the grounds of a loosely used cybercrime law. This talk will give some insight into the current social and political strife happening on the Saudi Internet from a first-hand-perspective using some of the data collected in a collaboration with the OONI project.", 
                                "description": "There is a simple reason why the Internet and social media have such an important role in the current struggle for social and political change: About 75 percent of the Saudi population are younger than 30 years old and basically everyone is online all the time: 75 percent of the Saudis have a smartphone and Saudi Twitter users account for 40 percent of all Twitter users in the whole Arab world. \r\n\r\nLife in the Kingdom is strongly influenced by the conflict between conservative-religious groups on one side and liberal activists on the other side who are trying to further democratic values, women's rights, free speech and freedom of religion. While the government is restricting public discourse, activists are pushing for reforms and are trying to make their voices heard.\r\n\r\nThis activism and so-called \u201eoverstepping of red lines\u201c comes at a price: Many have heard of the blogger Raif Badawi, who has been imprisoned in Saudi Arabia since 2012 and sentenced to 10 years in jail and 600 lashes for setting up a website that criticises religious figures. But fewer people are familiar with the cases of activists like Waleed Abulkhair, Ashraf Fayadh, Hamza Kashgari, Mariam al-Otaibi, Loujain AlHathloul and many others who are often charged and sentenced to prison for tweets or websites that they have put up under a very elastic clause in Saudi Arabias cyber crime law.\r\n\r\nThis talk strives to give some insight into the darkness of the current state of affairs on the Saudi internet as well as to show some of the rays of hope:\r\n\r\n1) We will have a look at Saudi Arabias cyber crime law which was instituted in 2007 and has since been amended multiple times: Now online newspapers and bloggers have to obtain a license and the government can monitor social media platforms to subsequently charge people for cyber crime or cyber terrorism for \u201epromoting\u201c adultery, homosexuality, atheism or criticizing the government or religious figures.\r\n\r\n2) While living in Saudi Arabia I collaborated with the OONI Project (Open Observatory of Network Interference: https://ooni.torproject.org/) to take measure of the extent of censorship and blocked websites in the Kingdom. In this talk we'll look at the method that I used to collect this data as well as the gathered information and what we can conclude from this about the state of Internet censorship in Saudi Arabia.\r\n\r\n3) And finally: Not all is lost. With years of relentless social media campaigns and the online organization of protest and dissent, activists are despite all the hardships they have suffered able to celebrate victories from time to time - like the recent lifting of the ban on women driving or the first participation of women in local elections.",

The Fitbit ecosystem is interesting to analyze, because Fitbit employs security measures such as end-to-end encryption and authentication to protect user data (and the Fitbit business model). Even though this goes beyond security mechanisms offered by other fitness tracker vendors, reverse-engineering the trackers enables us to launch practical attacks against Fitbit. In our talk, we demonstrate new attacks including wireless malware flashing on trackers as well as \u201cunlocking\u201d the trackers to work independent from the Fitbit cloud.", 
                                "description": "We explain the Fitbit security architecture, including the most important communication paradigms between tracker, app, and server. Our talk focuses on the tracker itself and its wireless interfaces, nevertheless it is important to understand the roles of the other components to successfully imitate them.\r\n\r\nCustom firmware makes fitness trackers the ultimate geek toy, including the possibility to improve security and privacy. We show how we reverse-engineered the wireless firmware flashing process, as well as setting up a Nexmon-based environment for developing custom firmware. A short demo shows how wireless flashing works, including potentials of the modified firmware.\r\n\r\nWe also release a smartphone application supporting a subset of the demonstrated attacks, including the possibility for users to extract some of their fitness tracker data without sharing it with Fitbit. This is a huge step towards privacy on wearables. Apart from the app we will also release everything necessary to patch your Fitbit firmware, enabling users to develop more secure mechanisms protecting their data.",

Mix networks resist vastly more powerful adversary models than Tor though, including global passive adversaries. In so doing, mix networks add both latency and cover traffic. We shall outline the basic components of a mix network, touch on their roles in resisting active and passive attacks, and discuss how the latency impacts reliability, application design, and user experience.", 
                                "description": "Interest in privacy technologies has surged over the previous decade, due in part to the Snowden revelations as well as earlier revelations of warrantless wiretaping by the NSA.  Tor has justifiably received considerable attention for protecting location metadata when using existing Internet protocols.  We believe the time is right though to deploy far stronger systems that cover more specific use cases, especially email and monetary transactions.\r\n\r\nThere are serious limitations to the adversary models addressed by Tor, which manifests today as website fingerprinting attacks, but easily extend to devastating attacks on most use cases, including messaging systems like Briar and Ricochet. \r\n\r\nAcademics have proposed various anonymity technologies with far stronger threat models than Tor, but by far the most deployable and efficient option remains mix networks, which date to the founding of anonymity research by David Chaum in 1981.  Tor was inspired by mix networks and shares some superficial similarities, but mix networks' are vastly stronger if they judiciously add latency and cover traffic.\r\n\r\nThere are several historical reasons why mixnets lost popularity and why Tor's onion routing won. Namely, Tor is\r\nlow latency and really good at being usable. This is in contrast to mix networks which are essentially an unreliable packet switching network. Historically mix networks achieved enough mix entropy by using long delays whereas it is becoming more widely understood that there exists a tradeoff between legit traffic, decoy traffic and latency.\r\n\r\nWe believe a strong anonymity network is urgently needed so that individuals can retain a core of control over what metadata they expose to traffic analysis. We further suspect the world is ready to pay for deploying it, and developing the specialized applications to exploit it, both for messaging privacy and for privacy preserving financial systems like ZCash or Taler.",

                                "description": "<p>Few years ago Samsung Galaxy S3 devices started dying all around the world (a phenomenon known as \"Galaxy S3 Sudden Death\"). The faulty hardware was pinpointed to its eMMC chip (made by Samsung). eMMC are basically SD cards in BGA form soldered to the PCB, but as it apperas - they hide a CPU and a firmware inside.</p>\r\n<p>Samsung eMMC chips support some vendor-specific, undocumented eMMC commands. By doing some guesswork and finding the right sequence of commands I was able to dump the entire RAM (and firmware) of the eMMC chip, which appears to sport an <i>ARM Cortex-M3</i> chip inside. But how can we know what causes the device to fail?</p>\r\n<p>Samsung has written a Linux patch which patches the eMMC's RAM in order to fix the problem. However, investigating the patch itself reveals that it does nothing more than jumping to an infinite loop when something goes wrong. We needed a more inherent fix. By utilizing Samsung's own vendor-specific commands, we can write the eMMC's RAM in order to achieve code execution, or even write to the eMMC's NAND flash memory directly. We can update its firmware and fix the problem altogether.</p>\r\n<p>However, when a device is bricked, how do we even get to send commands to its soldered eMMC chip by software-only means? I will show a working exploit against Samsung's boot-loader to be able to send commands to the eMMC chip.</p>\r\n<p>Nevertheless, this is not enough. A bricked device usually means that the eMMC is now in an infinite loop and won't accept and eMMC commands. Although it appears to be a dead-end, there's a way: by triggering a power reset on the eMMC chip, there's a time window in which the chip boots itself. There's a way to stop the eMMC chip from loading its own firmware, instead putting itself in some \"recovery mode\". I was finally able to execute my own code on the faulty chip.</p>\r\n<p>The research not only applies to Galaxy S3 devices (which are obviously old), as it appears to be relevant for new Samsung eMMC chips, even though they have a slightly different firmware, which will be briefly overviewed.</p>",

This one was no exception.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"https://github.com/golang/go/issues/20040\">Go issue #20040</a> affected the optimized x86_64 assembly implementation of scalar multiplication on the NIST P-256 elliptic curve in the standard library.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><code>p256SubInternal</code> computes <code>x - y mod p</code>. In order to be constant time it has to do both the math for <code>x &gt;= y</code> and for <code>x &lt; y</code>, it then chooses the result based on the carry bit of <code>x - y</code>. The old code chose wrong (<code>CMOVQNE</code> vs <code>CMOVQEQ</code>), but most of the times compensated by adding a carry bit that didn't belong in there (<code>ADCQ</code> vs <code>ANDQ</code>). Except when it didn't, once in a billion times (when <code>x - y &lt; 2^256 - p</code>). <a href=\"https://github.com/golang/go/commit/9294fa2749ffee7edbbb817a0ef9fe633136fa9c\">The whole patch is 5 lines.</a></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The bug was found by a Cloudflare engineer because it caused ECDSA verifications to fail erroneously but the security impact was initially unclear. We devised an adaptive bug attack that can recover a scalar input to <code>ScalarMult</code> by submitting attacker-controlled points and checking if the result is correct. Elliptic Curve Diffie-Hellman involves a secret scalar, a peer-provided point, and fails to establish a key if the result is incorrect.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We reported this to the Go team, Go 1.7.6 and 1.8.2 were issued and the vulnerability was assigned <a href=\"https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2017-8932\">CVE-2017-8932</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>At a high level, this P-256 ScalarMult implementation processes the scalar in blocks of 5 bits. We can precompute points that trigger the bug for each (and only) 5 bit value, and submit them. When the protocol fails, we learned 5 key bits, and we move on to the next 5, Hollywood style. In about 500 submissions on average we recover the whole key.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The precomputation involves a lot of unusable points and edge cases, but by modifying the optimized assembly implementation and generating points intelligently, we can produce a full round of points in seconds on 1000 machines (or spot instances). Each round depends on the previous ones, so must be computed live during each attack.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Normal ECDH does not offer an attacker multiple attempts against the same scalar, making the attack impossible. However, a variant of ECDH with a static scalar is used as a public key encryption scheme, for example in JSON Web Encryption. The attack can fully recover the private key in that scenario.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>No bug is small enough.</p>",

As a result, it\u2019s been removing the applications of Iranians off it\u2019s app store, to the detriment of all lot of Internet services Iranians with iPhones can access. Telegram has long been rumoured to be cooperating with the Iranian government. This past year they moved their CDN servers inside Iran, citing concerns for the security of Telegram data from the Iranian government. Telegram is one of the only social media platforms not censored in Iran, but now Iran\u2019s hardline politicians are threatening to sue Pavel Durov. Additionally, the new Minister of ICT has said they will be engaging Twitter in negotiations to unfilter the platform in Iran. Twitter is refusing to comment on whether they are engaging or will work with the government. This portion of the talk will try to understand the dangers and responsibilities companies have to keeping the Internet safe and accessible to Iranians. ",

More and more people are discovering that databrokers (a 200 billion dollar industry) are turning our data-trail into thousands of scores. This mostly invisible \u2018digital reputation\u2019 is starting to strongly effect our lives, influencing our chances to get a job, a cheap loan or even a nice date. \r\n\r\nAs awareness spreads people are changing their behavior; studies show a rise in self-censorship and a growing culture of risk-aversion. For example, after the Snowden revelations fewer people visit Wikipedia pages about subjects like terrorism. We see doctors hesitating to operate on patients because a death will lower their score. China is embracing it: in 2020 all Chinese citizens will receive a \u2018social credit score\u2019 that basically reflects how well behaved they are, and that will affect every part of their life.\r\n\r\nThis is the true cost of 'free': machine learning is mapping our weaknesses, and behavioral psychology is amplifying social pressure, creating powerful chilling effects and strong incentives to conform. I believe that as oil lead to Global Warming, data leads to Social Cooling. This comparison is not meant to scare, but to give us hope: our move away from oil offers us a valuable blueprint on how to deal with this issue. In this talk we'll go into the narratives we need.

During its evaluation, BootStomp discovered 6 previously unknown vulnerabilities across 4 different bootloaders. Finally BootStomp has been open-sourced to help the security community.", 
                                "description": "Modern mobile bootloaders play an important role in both the function and the security of the device. They help ensure the Chain of Trust (CoT), where each stage of the boot process verifies the integrity and origin of the following stage before executing it. This process, in theory, should be immune even to attackers gaining full control over the operating system, and should prevent persistent compromise of a device\u2019s CoT. However, not only do these bootloaders necessarily need to take untrusted input from an attacker in control of the OS in the process of performing their function, but also many of their verification steps can be disabled (\u201cunlocked\u201d) to allow for development and user customization. Applying traditional analyses on bootloaders is problematic, as hardware dependencies hinder dynamic analysis, and the size, complexity, and opacity of the code involved preclude the usage of many previous techniques.\r\n\r\nIn this paper, we explore vulnerabilities in both the design and implementation of mobile bootloaders. We examine bootloaders from four popular manufacturers, and discuss the standards and design principles that they strive to achieve. We then propose BootStomp , a multi-tag taint analysis resulting from a novel combination of static analyses and dynamic symbolic execution, designed to locate problematic areas where input from an attacker in control of the OS can compromise the bootloader\u2019s execution, or its security features. Using our tool, we find six previously-unknown vulnerabilities (of which five have been confirmed by the respective vendors), as well as rediscover one that had been previously reported. Some of these vulnerabilities would allow an attacker to execute arbitrary code as part of the bootloader (thus compromising the entire chain of trust), or to perform permanent denial-of-service attacks. Our tool also identified two bootloader vulnerabilities that can be leveraged by an attacker with root privileges on the OS to unlock the device and break the CoT. We conclude by proposing simple mitigation steps that can be implemented by manufacturers to safeguard the bootloader and OS from all of the discovered attacks, using already-deployed hardware features.",

                                "description": "EN (<a href=\"#langderr\">DE below</a>): The well-known computer pioneer and society critic Prof. Dr. Joseph Weizenbaum once said, \"Once upon a time, a problem was presented to the computer after it was understood. Today it's the other way around.\" Reasons for this seem to be an almost magical belief in technology, a strange misunderstanding of the functioning of today's computers, an ever-increasing financial pressure on the public sector and a widespread, technically-reduced \u2013 one could almost say 'cybernetic' \u2013 world view and concept of what's human.\r\n\r\nNot only since Google's artificial intelligence Alpha-Go won against the professional South Korean Go player Lee Sedol many techno-optimists celebrate the inferiority of the human brain. But Sedol metabolized a few cups of coffee for the match whereas Alpha-Go needed the energy of a small town; this shows that the matter is slightly more complicated. Similar misleading inaccuracies can be found regarding the 'famous' secret language of the Facebook bots or regarding the possibilities of \"smart contracts\" in the blockchain. These are examples of how misunderstood computer abilities and faulty ascription prevent a meaningful debate on the benefits of globally networked computer systems.\r\n\r\nHowever, such discussions are by no means purely academic or philosophical; they are socially highly explosive in their effect. As can be seen from the current addoption of Predictive Policing, the belief in the superiority of technology now creates harsh social realities for the affected 'data victims', but no noteworthy positive results for actual public security. The same applies to the automated \"intelligent\" video surveillance systems with behavioral detection \u2013 probably rolled-out nationwide in Germany: the belief in such systems immensely increases the cash influx of manufacturers and suppliers, but at the same time it reduces the freedom of each person in public space. These are the actual effects of an unchallenged 'blind computer optimism' driven by financial motivations which consequently transforms our society.\r\n\r\nFor a Digitalization supporting freedom and social development, expectations of information technology must be readjusted in the context of economic and political power relations.\r\n\r\n\r\n<span style=\"color:grey;\"><strong id=\"langderr\">DE</strong>: Der bekannte Computerpionier und Gesellschaftskritiker Prof. Dr. Joseph Weizenbaum sagte einst sinngem\u00e4\u00df: \u201eFr\u00fcher \u00fcbergab man ein Problem dem Computer, wenn man es verstanden hatte. Heute ist es anders herum\u201c. Gr\u00fcnde daf\u00fcr scheinen eine geradezu magische Technikgl\u00e4ubigkeit, ein merkw\u00fcrdiges Missverst\u00e4ndnis der Funktionsweise heutiger Computer, ein immer gr\u00f6\u00dfer werdender finanzieller Druck auf die \u00f6ffentliche Hand und ein weit verbreitetes, technisch-reduziertes \u2013 man k\u00f6nnte fast sagen 'kybernetisches' \u2013 Welt- und Menschenbild zu sein.\r\n\r\nDa gewinnt Googles k\u00fcnstliche Intelligenz Alpha-Go gegen den professionellen s\u00fcdkoreanischen Go-Spieler Lee Sedol und schon wird der Abgesang auf das menschliche Gehirn angestimmt. Doch dass Sedol f\u00fcr das Match ein paar Tassen Kaffee verstoffwechselte, aber Alpha-Go die Energie einer Kleinstadt, zeigt, dass die Lage geringf\u00fcgig komplizierter ist. \u00c4hnliche fehlleitende Ungenauigkeiten finden sich auch bez\u00fcglich der ber\u00fchmten Geheimsprache der Facebook-Bots bis hin zu den M\u00f6glichkeiten von \u201esmart contracts\u201c in der Blockchain. Dies sind Beispiele, wie missverstandene Computerf\u00e4higkeiten und Fehlzuschreibungen eine tats\u00e4chlich sinnvolle Diskussion \u00fcber den Nutzen weltweit vernetzter Computersysteme verhindern.\r\n\r\nDerartige Diskussionen sich jedoch mitnichten rein akademisch oder philosophisch, sondern in der Wirkung gesellschaftlich hoch brisant. Denn wie an der aktuellen Predictive-Policing-Thematik zu erkennen ist, erzeugt der Glaube an die \u00dcberlegenheit der Technik nunmehr harte soziale Realit\u00e4ten f\u00fcr die betroffenen 'Datenopfer', aber keine nennenswerten positiven Ergebnisse f\u00fcr die Sicherheit. Gleiches gilt f\u00fcr die automatisierte, sogenannte \u201eintelligente\u201c, Video\u00fcberwachung mit Verhaltenserkennung, die perspektivisch fl\u00e4chendeckend in Deutschland angedacht ist: der Glaube an solche Systeme vergr\u00f6\u00dfert zwar immens den Kassenstand der Hersteller und Anbieter, aber verkleinert in gleicher Weise die Freiheit und Freir\u00e4ume eines jeden Menschen im \u00f6ffentlichen Raum. Genau das sind die tats\u00e4chlichen Auswirkungen eines unwidersprochenen, blinden Computeroptimismus', der zudem von finanziellen Motivationen getrieben ist und in der Folge kontinuierlich unsere Gesellschaft umpr\u00e4gt.\r\n\r\nF\u00fcr eine Digitalisierung im Sinne der Freiheit und der gesellschaftlichen Weiterentwicklung m\u00fcssen die Erwartungen an die Informatik folglich neu justiert werden und das im Zusammenhang mit wirtschaftlichen und politischen Machtverh\u00e4ltnissen.</span>",

In der Planung sind Let's Plays f\u00fcr Minecraft und dem Worldpainter f\u00fcr Minecraft Welten! Es gehen aber auch alle anderen bereits installierten Spiele, die gerne gespielt werden! Kinder ab 10 Jahren, die gerne ihre eigenen let's Plays erstellen m\u00f6chten! Maximal 4-6 Kids, ausser wir bekommen noch Helfer! Wir gehen davon aus das Kids ihre eigene Ger\u00e4te mitbringen! Bisher haben wir den Workshop immer auf Laptops geprobt!\n\nDie Software kann unter folgenden Quellen geladen und anschlie\u00dfend installiert werden:\n\n* Screenrecording Software https://obsproject.com/ (Linux,OSX und Windows)\n* Freie Bildbearbeitungssoftware https://www.gimp.org/ (Linux,OSX und Windows)\n\n'''Achtung!''' F\u00fcr die Installation wird ein Administratorenpasswort des Rechners ben\u00f6tigt.\n\n\nNat\u00fcrlich darf bei jeder Session auch begeistert zugesehen werden und wer kein ad\u00e4quates Ger\u00e4t dabei  hat wird sicher auch einmal die M\u00f6glichkeit bekommen zu spielen!\nDie Anmeldung erfolgt vor Ort und falls die Zeit im Jugendhack Assembly abgelaufen ist finden wir mit Sicherheit noch eine ecke im Kidspace wo wir nach Lust und Laune weiter experimentieren k\u00f6nnen!",

Der Fokus liegt dabei vor allem auf der zumeist unbewussten Beeinflussung von Nutzerinnen und Nutzern durch personalisierte Nachrichtenempfehlungen, fake news sowie Bild-, Audio- und Videomanipulation. Die Forschung zeigt, dass ein Gro\u00dfteil der Nutzerinnen und Nutzer von sozialen Netzwerken wie Facebook sich der Tatsache, dass ihre Nachrichten zunehmend von Algorithmen ausgew\u00e4hlt und eingeschr\u00e4nkt werden, nicht bewusst ist. Wir erkunden, welche Folgen diese gl\u00e4sernen Echokammern haben und wie leicht sie Nutzerinnen und Nutzer beeinflussen k\u00f6nnen.\r\nEin Gro\u00dfteil der Daten, die diese Beeinflussung erm\u00f6glichen, entstehen dabei unbewusst und beil\u00e4ufig. Sie k\u00f6nnen aber R\u00fcckschl\u00fcsse auf Vorlieben und Verhalten der Nutzerinnen und Nutzer erm\u00f6glichen. Wie banal diese Daten sein k\u00f6nnen, veranschaulicht der Versuch von Banken, Kreditw\u00fcrdigkeit anhand von Postleitzahlen vorherzusagen. Ein ambitioniertes Beispiel bietet Prof. Dr. Michal Kosinski, ein Psychologe aus Stanford, der behauptet, dass er die sexuelle Orientierung eines Menschen an seinem Gesicht erkennen kann.\r\nDie Beispiele zeigen wie die statistischen Werkzeuge des Maschinellen Lernens zunehmend von Laien verwendet werden, die die Richtigkeit ihrer Vorhersagen nur bedingt einsch\u00e4tzen k\u00f6nnen und die die Grenzen der Werkzeuge nicht hinreichend verstehen. Nichtsdestotrotz werden zunehmend Entscheidungen automatisiert auf Basis von Daten getroffen. Diese Entscheidungen treffen dabei vordergr\u00fcndig Algorithmen, die objektiv scheinen. Sie lernen aber alle Verzerrungen (Biases), die in den Daten angelegt sind. Alarmierendes Beispiel hierf\u00fcr ist die Nutzung von Algorithmen im US-Justizsystem, wo eine Risikosoftware namens COMPAS systematisch Wei\u00dfe bevorteilt und Afroamerikaner benachteiligt.\r\nZiel des Vortrages ist es, M\u00f6glichkeiten der Beeinflussung durch K\u00fcnstliche Intelligenz aufzuzeigen und Zuh\u00f6rerinnen und Zuh\u00f6rer in die Lage zu versetzen, Chancen und Gefahren dieser Entwicklungen zu bewerten.",

While it is well-known that CPUs feature a microcode update mechanism, very little is known about its inner workings given that microcode and the update mechanism itself are proprietary and have not been throughly analyzed yet. We close this gap by both analyzing microcode and writing our own programs for it. This talk will give an insight into our results and how we achieved them, including live demos of what we can do and technical details.", 
                                "description": "Given the complexity of modern instruction sets hardware vendors moved to hardware designs incorporating complex decode units. A single instruction of the complex outwardfacing instruction set is translated to multiple instructions of the simpler internal architecture. While it is possible to do this translation in hardware alone, some instructions would require huge amounts of space on the silicon and increase costs. These complex instructions are instead decoded using a software-like approach called microcode. While processing such an instruction, the CPU internally evaluates a sequence of operations, micro-ops, which decode the complex instruction into the corresponding simpler operations that are performed by the hardware.\r\n\r\nIn the light of the existence of hardware bugs such as the infamous Pentium fdiv bug, hardware vendors developed a process to fix those errors without requiring a CPU replacement. However the microcode is stored in a ROM on the CPU die and can not be changed after production. Also relatively simple or often used instructions are still decoded in hardware. The update is instead achieved using microcode updates, which intercept certain instructions and replace their faulty implementation with a new, fixed version. These updates are applied either by the BIOS/UEFI or the operating system during early bootup. While the update process is well documented, the Linux kernel offers a module for it, and the updates are provided by the CPU vendors, the actual semantics of microcode are proprietary.\r\n\r\nMost update mechanisms are protected by signatures or other cryptographic primitives. However there were some indications that older CPU models (until around 2013) do not have a strong cryptographic protection and thus would accept custom updates. Given this chance we started to analyze the behavior of the CPU given our own updates and used these observations to infer the semantics of microcode. After some time we reverse-engineered enough of the semantics to write our own microcode programs. These programs range from very simple proof of concepts to stealthy backdoors and defensive primitives.\r\n\r\nAs an additional approach we also performed hardware analysis. By delayering the CPU and imaging it with both an optical and an electron microscope we could locate and read out the ROM containing the microcode. After processing and reordering the physical connections we retrieved the hardwired microcode of the CPU. This gave us more information on what can be done with microcode and allowed more insights into the intended behavior than our reverse-engineering approach.\r\n\r\nIn this talk we will first start with a (short) crash course in CPU architecture and where microcode is used in practice. We will then cover our reverse engineering methods and how we were able to discover the semantics of x86 microcode. We then demonstrate, also with live demos, this knowledge with multiple microcode programs that implement both defensive measures as well as provide an attacker with hard to detect backdoors. Lastly we will discuss security problems and possible solutions to protect against them. We also provide example microcode programs for your own CPUs (use at your own risk) and a kernel patch to apply them on a Linux system. Also we will have some systems with us so you can try your hand at writing some microcode yourself.\r\n",

                                "description": "It\u2019s an exciting time for public-key cryptography. With the threat of practical quantum computers looming in the next few decades, it\u2019s high time to replace the systems that can be broken by a quantum computer with ones that remain secure even if the attacker has a quantum computer. However, this is easier said than done \u2013 there is no consensus what replacements should be chosen and how secure the systems are. NIST has just started a 5-7 year competition with the target to recommend a portfolio of post-quantum encryption and signature schemes. Considerations will be speed, bandwidth, and of course security.\r\n\r\nSeveral of the submissions are based on lattices. At our current level of understanding, lattice-based cryptography offers relatively small public keys for both encryption and signatures, while having good performance and reasonably sized ciphertexts and signatures. While these features are nice and make us want to know more about lattices, that world can be a scary place full of discussions of Minkowski bounds, Gaussian distributions, and orthogonalized bases. We will show how these schemes work in accessible terms.\r\n\r\nLattices have been used in cryptography for more than thirty years, but for most of that only as a tool to attack systems, starting with knapsack systems in the early 80\u2019s. Lattices can also be used to break conventional public-key cryptosystems such as RSA or Diffie-Hellman when they are incorrectly implemented. This talk will explain these fun attacks in concrete terms, with code you can run at home.\r\n\r\nAlgorithms will be presented as Python/Sage code snippets and will already be online before the talk at https://latticehacks.cr.yp.to.\r\n\r\nThis is a joint presentation by Daniel J. Bernstein, Nadia Heninger, and Tanja Lange, surveying work by many people.",

Um das Presserecht auszuhebeln, nutzte das Innenministerium das Vereinsrecht. Kurzerhand erkl\u00e4rten sie einige ihnen bekannte Freiburger Autonome zu Mitgliedern eines Vereins \u201eIndymedia linksunten\u201d und das Autonome Zentrum KTS Freiburg zum \u201eVereinsheim\u201c. \r\n\r\nUm \u00fcberhaupt erst gerichtsfeste Belege f\u00fcr das Vereinsverbot und die Zuordnung der Betroffenen zu diesem Verein zu beschaffen, wurden vier Wohnungen und das \u201eVereinsheim\u201d durchsucht.

Against \u201eJugend Rettet\u201c and all the other NGOs that do search and rescue (SAR) in the mediterranean sea.",

Which surveillance and intelligence techniques were used by the authorities to gather evidence. Evidence that has not been found, because it does not exist. We will describe who initiated the investigation against \u201eJugend Rettet\u201c and show how fascists, secret service and police worked hand in hand to stop the \u201eIuventa\u201c from saving people from drowning.\r\n\r\nThe seizure of the \u201eIuventa\u201c was neither the begin nor the end of a\r\nsmear campaign to discredit the work done by the civil search and rescue fleet. It was a small part in much bigger game played by the european union to discredit the work of the NGOs working in the mediterranean. In our talk we will explain why there is such a big interest by the European states to hinder their work and how the European Union is actually breaking international law to do so.\r\n\r\nStarting with a Frontex strategy paper from January 2016 we will describe how the European Union tries to externalize their borders onto the African continent. To places where there are no cameras or eye witnesses to show the European public the deadliness of their borders.\r\n\r\nFinally we\u2019d like to discuss what is still possible despite the growing pressure by the european states. How can we fight fortress Europe? How do we defend us against the accusations? What have we reached? What can we still reach?\r\n\r\nKathrin has been operating in search & rescue projects in the Aegean and Mediterranean for the last 21 months, since August 2016 she is supporting Jugend Rettet as Field Coordinator, RHIB driver and Head of Mission. 2017 she trained and briefed all crews that operated on the Iuventa and joined a number of missions off the Libyan coast - including the last one in which the ship was seized.\r\n\r\nShe was confronted not only with the fact that Jugend Rettet had been subject to surveillance by Italian authorities over months but also with the confiscation of her personal belongings including laptop and cell phones. Ever since she continued fighting along with Jugend Rettet against a legal, political and media campaign that aims to criminalise civil search and rescue organisations. \r\n\r\nHendrik has been on rescue missions with different NGOs since autumn 2016. He joined Jugend Rettet in June and July 2017 for two consecutive missions as RHIB driver and RHIB team lead. He was part of one of the missions where an undercover investigator raised accusations against the crew.\r\n\r\nSince the seizure of the Iuventa he is busy working with the team that is fighting the accusations and the media campaign against civil search and rescue organisations.",

                                "abstract": "In 2015, artist Ai Weiwei was bugged in his home, presumably by government actors. This situation raised our awareness on the lack of research in our community about operating and detecting spying microphones. Our biggest concern was that most of the knowledge came from fictional movies. Therefore, we performed a deep study on the state-of-the-art of microphone bugs, their characteristics, features and pitfalls. It included real life experiments trying to bug ourselves and trying to detect the hidden mics. Given the lack of open detection tools, we developed a free software SDR-based program, called Salamandra, to detect and locate hidden microphones in a room. After more than 120 experiments we concluded that placing mics correctly and listening is not an easy task, but it has a huge payoff when it works. Also, most mics can be detected easily with the correct tools (with some exceptions on GSM mics). In our experiments the average time to locate the mics in a room was 15 minutes. Locating mics is the novel feature of Salamandra, which is released to the public with this work. We hope that our study raises awareness on the possibility of being bugged by a powerful actor and the countermeasure tools available for our protection.", 
                                "description": "Most of what the general public knows about microphones bugs comes from movies and other fictional sources, which usually is far from real. An example of these inaccuracies is the public speculation made by the Counselor of the United States President, Kellyanne Conway, who expressed that a microwave oven can spy as a camera; the answer is NO, as refuted in article by WIRED. The current literature about microphones bugs is disturbingly scarce, leaving most people to believe the myths distributed by the media. One of the goals of this work is to debunk the fictional beliefs around mics bugs by performing a thorough study and real life experiments with them.\r\nThis paper is divided into three phases. First, we perform a survey of the state-of-the-art of mic bugs and their characteristics. Second, we develop our own free software detection tool, called Salamandra. Third, we perform several real life experiments on placing and detecting bugs to examine how difficult it was. Finally, we conclude with a thorough analysis of our experience.\r\nThe first phase makes a deep survey of all the civilian-accessible microphone bugs. It takes into account physical characteristics, frequencies, transmission modes, battery options, operational lifetime, operational listening distance, easiness of listening by the operator, advantages & disadvantages, configurations if any, and easiness of detection by various means. The end goal of the first phase is to show the difficulty in using microphone bugs.\r\nThe second phase presents our free software, SDR-based tool to detect hidden microphones called Salamandra. Although a professional microphone search usually requires more complex hardware, we show that a simple SDR USB device and our tool can be used to detect the mic bugs accurately. Moreover, Salamandra has a novel location feature to find mics quickly; a feature that is not available in most commercial detectors. The two most important limitations of the hardware detection solutions are their false detection of mics and their false positive detections of ghost mics.\r\nSalamandra uses several novel techniques to detect mics by taking advantage of its execution in a computer, including continuous discovery and location of mics.\r\nThe third phase consists in a group of offensive/defensive experiments on placing and detecting bugs in real life. While one of the researchers places the mics and tries to listen to meaningful spoken passwords, the other runs Salamandra to try to know if there was a mic and where. These real life experiments shone light about the difficulty of placing mics and how easy is to find them.\r\nAs far as we know this work is one of the few on the topic of analyzing the real performance of placing and detecting spying microphones. The main contributions of this paper are:\r\n\u2022 As far as we know, the first scientific research on the topic of real life spy microphones.\r\n\u2022 A novel free software SDR-based detection tool to locate microphone bugs, called Salamandra.

So far, IoT is more a wide range of disaster plots with a lot of security and privacy concerns that are a danger for the internet rather than they are the world-saving development the tech guys predict. One example: connected (sex) toys. Some countries already banned them or are planning to ban them. Another example are digital home assistants that tend to change our sense of privacy. \r\n\r\nBut what can we do? We can\u2019t stop the development, but we can make products safer. In my talk I am going to present current examples where IoT fails in terms of privacy, security and use case. Rather than going into technical detail of \u201eHow did that hack work out?\u201c I want to concentrate on the ethical and practical problems that arise out of connecting everything. I also want to focus on how consumers can influence the market and what we all can do as a society. \r\n\r\nFor example: Currently manufacturers take care primarily of their business to bring the products quickly to the market, and less to the safety of it. In my talk, I would like to show some examples and explain why this becomes the problem for all of us - and what regulators plan to stop that. As customers we are also not doomed, we can help to stop this internet of fails. ",

These well-planned systemic efforts escalated with the Hong Kong police targeting the Snowden Refugees, instead of providing protection to them.\r\nThe Hong Kong government has been aggressively seeking to rapidly remove Vanessa and her stateless daughter to the Philippines under conditions of a nation-wide state of emergency, martial law in Mindanao and a recently catalyzed nation-wide civil war with the National People\u2019s Army. In the name of a war on drugs, President Duterte directed the well-planned and systematic use of torture, arbitrary arrest and detention, enforced disappearances and extra-judicial killings of tens of thousands of innocent civilians including politicians, with no end in sight. His actions amount to crimes against humanity.\r\nThe Hong Kong government also seeks to deport the Sri Lankan Snowden Refugees to a country accused of having committed war crimes, crimes against humanity and genocide, with its current Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe accused of being complicit in war crimes and crimes against humanity. Today Sri Lanka is plagued by systemic use of torture, arbitrary arrest and detention, enforced disappearances and extrajudicial killings with no end in sight. \r\nIn the above context, the Hong Kong government has failed to protect the Snowden Refugees and in fact have taken steps to put them in harms\u2019 way both in Hong Kong and their countries of origin.",

It is found in everything from BlackBerry products, carrier-grade routers and medical devices to military radios, UAVs and nuclear powerplants. On top of that, it dominates the automotive market and is found in millions of cars.\r\n\r\nWhile some prior security research has discussed QNX, mainly as a byproduct of BlackBerry mobile research, there is no prior work on QNX exploit mitigations or its secure random number generators.\r\n\r\nThis talk seeks to close that gap by presenting the first reverse-engineering and analysis of the exploit mitigations, secure random number generators and memory management internals of QNX. We dissect the NX / DEP, ASLR, Stack Cookies and RELRO mitigations as well as the /dev/random and kernel PRNGs.\r\n\r\nWe subsequently uncover a variety of design issues and vulnerabilities in these mitigations and PRNGs, which have significant implications for the exploitability of memory corruption vulnerabilities on QNX as well as the strength of its cryptographic ecosystem. Finally, we provide information on available patches and hardening measures available to defenders seeking to harden their QNX-based systems against the discussed issues.",

To help reduce the effort needed to get a foothold into a new system, we present GlitchKit-- an open source hardware and firmware solution that significantly simplifies the process of fault-injecting your way into a new system -- and of fault-injecting firmware secrets out! This talk presents the development completed thus far, demonstrates the use of GlitchKit in simple attacks, and invites participation in the development of our open-source tools.", 
                                "description": "Work by a variety of authors has demonstrated the vulnerability of hardware peripherals to fault-injection-driven firmware-disclosure attacks [1]-- or in other words: glitching attacks that cause devices to 'accidentally' disclose their own firmware. A common form of this attack exploits the behavior of hardware peripherals as they send out bits of read-only memory-- by inducing a glitch at the end of a communication, transmitters can often be inticed to transmit memory beyond the end of the scheduled communcation, often leaking firmware and other device secrets.\r\n\r\nFor glitching attacks to function properly, glitches must be precisely timed relative to communication events-- a requirement that often requires reverse engineers to develop purpose-built glitch-triggering hardware. GitchKit helps to relieve this burden-- providing an easy, context-aware glitching toolkit that can synchronize glitch events to a variety of communications events, including events generated by common protocols such as USB. GlitchKit builds atop existing open-source software and hardware-- including the GreatFET communications multitool, the FaceDancer USB-hacking toolkit, and the ChipWhisperer fault-injection toolkit-- and provides an entirely-open-source stack for easy glitching-- hopefully making it easier for you to get your hands on that elusive piece of firmware!\r\n\r\nThis talk presents the theory behind firmware-disclosure glitching, and aims to help every hacker start using open-source tools to start opening up closed systems. Accordingly, we discuss the current state of the GlitchKit project, describe in detail how it can be used to 'break open' existing closed systems, and provide live demonstration of GlitchKit features.\r\n\r\n[1] e.g, http://scanlime.org/2016/10/scanlime015-glitchy-descriptor-firmware-grab/",

These parts do not give away the secret on\r\ntheir own. Instead, the user defines the minimal amount of shares needed to\r\nrestore the original secret. In this way, there is no need to trust a <em>single</em>\r\nentity. Additionally, compromise or loss of one share does not mean a \r\ncompromise or loss of the entire secret. This makes it very suitable for\r\nbacking up private keys, such as Bitcoin keys. Shamir secret sharing can\r\nalso be used for passing on your secrets to your trusted successors, in case\r\nyou get hit by a bus.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nIn this talk, I will explain in detail how the scheme works. Although it is \r\nprovably secure for confidentiality, we will see how it fails for integrity\r\nand how to fix that. While Shamir published his article almost 30 years ago,\r\nmost existing libraries for Shamir secret sharing are still implemented\r\npoorly in terms of security and side-channel resistance.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nI will talk about writing the definitive library for Shamir secret sharing.\r\nWe will choose suitable parameters and implement the scheme in C. We will\r\nsee a couple of tricks that cryptographers use for building fast algorithms\r\nwhile still maintaining side-channel resistance. In the end, we (hope to)\r\nhave produced a robust algorithm ready for easy integration into your favorite\r\nproject.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nBasic understanding of some mathematical topics (such as group theory) may\r\nbe helpful for this talk, but is not required.\r\n</p>",

Interestingly, the susceptibility of electronic devices to electromagnetic interference has been advertised since the 90\u2019s. Regarding the high integration of sensors and digital systems to control power-grids, telecom networks and automation infrastructures (e.g. Smart-grids, Industrial Control Systems), the intrinsic vulnerability of electronic devices to electromagnetic interference is of fundamental interest. In the context of IT Security, few studies have been carried out to understand how the effects may be a significant issue especially in the far-field region (distance between the transmitter\u2019s antenna and the target with regard to the wavelength/central frequency). Most studies in Emanation Security (EMSEC) are related to near-field probing for side-channel and fault injection attacks assuming a close physical access to the targeted devices. In this paper, we propose a methodology to detect, classify and correlate the effect induced during the intentional exposure of analogue and digital systems to electromagnetic interference. Applying this methodology, the implication of the effects for the IT security world will be discussed with regards to the attacker profile needed to set-up a given scenario. ",

Unfortunately, SafetyNet Attestation is not well documented by Google. This talk is split into three parts. Part one provides a deep dive into SafetyNet Attestation how it works. Part two is a guide on how to implement and use it for real world applications. This is based on the lessons learned from implementing SafetyNet Attestation for an app with a large install base. The talk will provide you with everything you need to know about Android\u2019s SafetyNet Attestation and will help you to implement and use it in your app. Part three presents attacks and bypasses against SafetyNet Attestation.

Existing\r\nattacks against ASLR rely on software vulnerabilities and/or on\r\nrepeated (and detectable) memory probing.\r\n\r\nIn this talk, we show that neither is a hard requirement\r\nand that ASLR is fundamentally insecure on modern cache-\r\nbased architectures, making ASLR and caching conflicting\r\nrequirements (ASLR xor Cache, or simply AnC). To support\r\nthis claim, we describe a new EVICT+TIME cache attack\r\non the virtual address translation performed by the memory\r\nmanagement unit (MMU) of modern processors. Our AnC attack\r\nrelies on the property that the MMU's page-table walks result\r\nin caching page-table pages in the shared last-level cache (LLC).\r\n\r\nAs a result, an attacker can derandomize virtual addresses of a\r\nvictim's code and data by locating the cache lines that store the\r\npage-table entries used for address translation.\r\nRelying only on basic memory accesses allows AnC to be\r\nimplemented in JavaScript without any specific instructions or\r\nsoftware features. We show our JavaScript implementation can\r\nbreak code and heap ASLR in two major browsers running on\r\nthe latest Linux operating system with 28 bits of entropy in 150\r\nseconds. We further verify that the AnC attack is applicable to\r\nevery modern architecture that we tried, including Intel, ARM\r\nand AMD. Mitigating this attack without naively disabling caches\r\nis hard, since it targets the low-level operations of the MMU.\r\nWe conclude that ASLR is fundamentally flawed in sandboxed\r\nenvironments such as JavaScript and future defenses should not\r\nrely on randomized virtual addresses as a building block.\r\n",

The radio signal is AES-128 encrypted and the system is marketed to be \u201cas secure as online banking\u201d. In comparison to conventional and often trivial to break wireless access control systems, the system should thus make it practically infeasible to clone a genuine transmitter so that attackers can get unauthorized access. We used the low-cost CCC rad1o software defined radio (SDR) platform to intercept and analyze the wireless radio signal. We took apart several Hoermann BiSecur hand transmitters and subsequently utilized a vulnerability in the microcontroller to successfully extract the firmware. In order to conduct a security audit, the extracted firmware was disassembled and analyzed so that the encryption mechanism, the key material, the cryptographic operations as well as the RF interface could be reverse engineered. Our security analysis shows that the overall security design is sound, but the manufacturer failed to properly initialize the random seed of the transmitters. As a result, an attacker can intercept an arbitrary radio frame and trivially compute the utilized encryption key within less than a second. Once the key is known to the attacker, a genuine transmitter can be cloned with an SDR platform such as the CCC rad1o. In addition to unauthorized operation of gates and doors, there is a likely (although currently untested) impact on Smart Home appliances that use the BiSecur system. We tested a total of 7 hand transmitters from 3 different model series and with manufacturing dates between 2015 and 2017. All analyzed hand transmitters shared the same static random seed and were found to be vulnerable to our attack. The vulnerability can easily be fixed so that future hand transmitters and radio transmission are protected from our attack.",

In particular, following criteria played a central role: feasibility, time spent on DIY production, costs, aesthetics and impact on wheelchair users. \r\nFrom numerous ideas and prototypes, two products have gained resonance amongst users - OPEN LIGHTS, a wheelchair lighting feature and OPEN TRAILER, a wheelchair trailer. \r\nThe project is completely open source and can be reproduced by users themselves with DIY rapid prototyping technologies. The designs and files can be downloaded for free under Creative Commons License. It is important to us that the products can be easily and inexpensively replicated so that as many wheelchair users can benefit from them. ",

In German nursing sciences the dominant position on emergent technologies demands the removal of machines from caring environments (\u201eEntmaschinisierung\u201c). In contrast to this, European research policy heavily focus on developing new health and social technologies to solve societal issues like a skill shortage in nursing. In this talk we first give an overview on main arguments against digital technologies in care with an example of a current research project in the field of Augmented Reality in care work. Secondly, we argue that those luddite positions in nursing science are losing touch with their subject\u2019s reality. Consequently, they are about to miss another chance to establish their sphere of influence.", 
                                "description": "In the first part of this talk we introduce current positions of German nursing science and German nurses on emergent technologies. For German nursing scientists the main element of nursing is the relationship between the patient and their nurse. One central aspect of this relationship is communication. Corporal [\u201cLeib\u201d] perception is stressed as well as implicit or tacit knowledge. Nursing experts are presumed to use these kinds of knowledge to guide their action. It is argued that digitalization stands in the way of using these kinds of non-discursive knowledge, as digital technology is only able to display discursive knowledge. Thus, care logic and logic of technology are described as incommensurable. \r\nNevertheless, usage of electronic health records is increasing. Furthermore, a wide range of prototypes are developed as they are conceived as solutions regarding existing problems at least from certain points of view. E.g. Smart Devices can be used to support blood sampling or the documentation process. We will show you a prototype which is part of our research project, to offer you the possibility to get your own ideas of advantages and disadvantages.\r\nIn the second part of this talk the theoretical premises of main arguments against technology will be revealed and a counterperspective will be introduced. The progress of biotechnologies in some way stimulates a slowly growing mutual interest of the humanities and natural sciences. Notwithstanding in nursing science there is still a hostile attitude against if not a categorical denial of technologies ranging from robotic systems to smart home technologies and even the PC. Emergent technologies are mistakenly seen as strongly (and only) bound to medicine and hence being hopelessly fought. On closer consideration it becomes obvious that the theoretical premises of this perspective is deeply linked to the idea of human exceptionalism. In their (neo-) humanistic vindication nursing scientists seek to set themselves free from the influence of medicine as a dominant discipline. In doing so technology becomes the uncanny \u201cother\u201d. For it is a question of perspective a brief glimpse into the idea of Gilbert Simondon on the \u201copen machine\u201d will be offered as a possibility to rethink the relation between humans and technology. \r\n",

Many video games are about driving cars, whether it is for racing, or heisting and escaping the police. In this talk, we will explain how the user experience could actually be improved by connecting a car to a video game and turning it into a game controller.\r\n\r\nWe will discuss about these connected systems, how car components interact with one another, the different protocols, or anything that came to us during this journey.\r\n\r\nHowever there was one important constraint during all that experience: no car could be dismantled nor modified. The main goal of this analysis was to try doing something out of the data which could be freely recovered while plugging itself to the OBD-II port of a car. As mentioned, this resulted in the possibility of controlling a video game car through the real car, like a simulator, without the need of modifying anything in the car itself.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately, this requires a lot of gasoline to have the engine powered on and run. Moreover, gasoline is really expensive in France. So we looked for a way to reduce that cost. We actually found a nice device on the Internet to optimize the amount of gasoline used by the engine. Apparently, it works by connecting to the OBD-II port and reconfigures the engine\u2019s ECU. We looked into that to understand what was actually going on\u2026 and try to reduce the cost of the drifting.\r\n\r\nThe following points will be mentioned during the presentation:\r\nECUs\r\nCAN bus\r\nOBD-II (DTCs/PIDs)\r\nOn-top-of-CAN protocols\r\nUDS (Diagnostic/Security session)\r\nReverse engineering: the meanings of CAN messages\r\nUsing a real car as a simulator, for poories\r\nMinor details about how to create a custom game controller\r\nOBD dongle reverse engineering",

A key source of inspiration for the artworks on display is Afrofuturism, a movement that emerged in the mid-twentieth century against the backdrop of the African-American community's historical experience of racism and discrimination. Telling tales of speculative futures, it opened up a space for a distinct history, and hence emancipation, self-empowerment and individual freedom. The concepts, ideas and aesthetics of Afrofuturism soon spread from the USA to the rest of the world, influencing countless artists \u2013 also in German-speaking countries \u2013 with whose experiences they strongly resonated.",

This prompted the idea of developing QBDI which has been in development for two years and a half.\r\n\r\nWith QBDI we wanted to try a modern take on DBI framework design and build a tool crafted to support mobile architectures from the start, adopting a modular design enabling its integration with other tools and that was easy to use by abstracting all the low-level details from the users.\r\n\r\nIn this talk we will review the motivation behind the usage of a DBI. We will explain its core principle and the main implementation challenges we faced. We will go through a few of the existing frameworks (Intel Pin, Valgrind, DynamoRIO) and compare our implementation choices with theirs. Finally, we will demo our framework and showcase its integration inside Frida.\r\n\r\nWe also plan to open source our framework under a permissive free software license (Apache 2) during the conference.",

Our main focus are the face recognition tests by German security authorities and the German train company (DB). We have been active during this year informing the public, press and people passing through the train station S\u00fcdkreuz (test area) and protesting publicly. \n\nWe consist of two things: the active group meeting regularly in Berlin and the mailing list which grew rapidly during this year. \nThe idea of our meetup is to talk in real life to those people on the mailing list and to other people interested in our action. \n\nWe will meet at 1Komona BIKINI (not Coral reef) \nContact best via twitter @ENDSTATIONSUEDX",

Wir sprechen mit Menschen (fast) aller Altersklassen und Hintergr\u00fcnde und haben nicht nur unseren flauschigen Kollegen, den Dugong Dilhan - eine Gabelschwanzseekuh - sondern auch Experimente mit Meeresbezug und aktuelle Forschungsthemen im Gep\u00e4ck. Nat\u00fcrlich freuen wir uns ebenso \u00fcber pers\u00f6nliche Fragen, die wir sehr gern aus unserer Perspektive, also meist aus dem Leben eines Wissenschaftlers, beantworten. Unser Versuch, mit Leuten von der Stra\u00dfe \u00fcber Wissenschaft zu sprechen, hat uns oft mit unvorhersehbaren Fragen und Situationen \u00fcberrascht. Wir nennen unsere Arbeit in der Wissenschaftskommunikation deshalb auch #harteformate und m\u00f6chten euch einen ersten Einblick und Diskussionsm\u00f6glichkeit \u00fcber diese Form von WissKomm geben. Vielleicht wagt ihr euch dann auch an ungewohnte Zielgruppen, die mit ein wenig charmanter Arbeit zu tollen Gespr\u00e4chspartnern werden und deren Neugier f\u00fcr euer Thema geweckt wird.",

Wir sind beide Wissenschaftler und zeigen euch, wie ihr vorgehen k\u00f6nnt, wenn ihr auch mal an so eine Frage geratet. Wir recherchieren und diskutieren gemeinsam \u00fcber eine Frage, die wir bis zum Workshop auch nicht kannten: weil sie n\u00e4mlich von euch kommt! Wo finde ich gute Informationen? Welche Quelle ist seri\u00f6s? Wo sollte ich lieber vorsichtig sein? Lasst und das gemeinsam rausfinden! Ab 11:00 Uhr Workshop 60-90 Minuten. Ab 10 Jahren!",

Currently, Google, Facebook and other companies who live off user data monetization are the only ones offering Internet-wide single-sign-on services to average users; these services build more walled gardens which give no choice, no rights and no freedoms to the users. This is why it is strategically important to create an open alternative: a federated, public, free identity infrastructure for the Internet that would give users the same level of convenience and security, but empower them to choose their identity provider and control which personal information is shared and to whom. \n\nThe session will open with a general presentation, including data, of how the big OTTs are growing and focusing their revenue sources on advertising and on tracking online identities, centralizing the economy of the Internet and of the world, to prove how crucial this issue is. Then, the talk will discuss introduce the work done within the DomainID/iNetID project to create a decentralized public identity infrastructure for the open Internet, going into technical details on the proposed architecture, and looking for community feedback and participation.",

                                "description": "Twenty-five years after the end of the Cold War, there are still about 15,000 nuclear weapons in the arsenals of the nine nuclear weapon states. After an era of transparency, cooperation, and confidence-building in the 1990s, progress in nuclear arms control has slowed down in the 2000s and is currently in a crisis. The newly negotiated Treaty on the Prohibition of Nuclear Weapons (\u201cBan Treaty\u201d) and the 2017 Nobel Peace Prize have given new attention to the enduring threat posed by these weapons and the urgency of further reductions. Any further progress toward nuclear disarmament will have to rely on robust verification mechanisms, especially while there is limited trust among relevant states. This requires trusted measurement systems to confirm the authenticity of nuclear warheads based on their radiation signatures. These signatures are considered sensitive information, the systems have to be designed to protect them. To accomplish this task, so-called \u201cinformation barriers\u201d have been proposed. These devices process the sensitive information acquired during an inspection, but only display results in a pass/fail manner. Traditional inspection systems rely on complex electronics both for data acquisition and processing. Several research efforts have produced prototype systems following fundamentally different design philosophies, but it has proven difficult to demonstrate that hidden switches and side channels do not exist. After almost 30 years of research and development, no viable and widely accepted system has emerged.\r\n\r\nWe pursue a fundamentally different approach: Our prototype of an inspection system uses vintage hardware built around a 6502 processor. The processor uses 8-micron technology (about 600 times larger than current 14-nanometer technology) and has only about 3500 transistors. Vintage hardware may have a number of important advantages for applications where two parties need to simultaneously establish trust in the hardware used. CPUs designed in the distant past, at a time when their use for sensitive measurements was never envisioned, drastically reduce concerns that the other party implemented backdoors or hidden switches on the hardware level. Today, the design of the 6502 is de-facto open source, and several projects have explored the hardware in great detail (visual6502.org, monster6502.com). The technology is so basic that it would be difficult or impossible to surreptitiously implement extra functionalities that could be used to leak secret information. For the same reason, however, using vintage hardware also comes at a price, as the performance of the inspection system is limited, and data acquisition and processing has to be designed and highly optimized accordingly. \r\n\r\nIn this talk, we demonstrate the performance of the inspection system in an actual inspection setting. For this purpose, we built a prototype system using an Apple IIe and a custom-made open-source data-processing board connected to a sodium-iodide radiation detector for low-resolution gamma spectroscopy. Data processing and analysis is exclusively done on the Apple IIe hardware. In inspection mode, the Apple IIe is used as an information barrier, and the result of the analysis is simply displayed by a green/red (pass/fail) LED on the data-processing board. To wrap up, we discuss the broader context required for verifying deeper cuts in the nuclear arsenals and demonstrate the system as part of a notional inspection scenario, including its capability to detect basic cheating scenarios, in which a dishonest party presents an invalid item that has a different radiation signature.\r\n",

This will cover what border agents are theoretically capable of doing to compromise devices, and what precautions you can take to secure your data before this interaction occurs.

We will explore how Apple Pay works on a technical level and why you are able to 'clone' your credit card onto your phone.

This trend is not likely to stop anytime soon and it is time to understand what is going on the lower layers.\r\n\r\nTo jumpstart the discussion, we will first have a look at all the parties involved in a card transaction and where they are placed in the communication and decision chain. From there we are comparing the differences between a chip (ICC) and a contactless (NFC) transaction.\r\n\r\nAfterwards we are ready to look at Apple Pay, Android Pay and other card emulations. Even though they provide the same features on first look, they work fundamentally different on the technical level. We will learn about storing sensitive transaction information offline on the device in a Secure Element (SE) or online with your service provider utilizing Hosted Card Emulation (HCE).\r\n\r\nIn the end, we will take a short look at how contactless payments might influence our future, why legacy is still king and if tokenization might just save your day one time.",

Corpus linguistics is the study of language based on examples of real life language use and works with large amount of data.  In this talk I will analyse the context of keywords which are used in the parliamentary debates and the respective media coverage concerning the passing of the Snooper\u2019s Charter. Using methods of corpus linguistics I want to show how central terms are constructed entirely different in these two spheres. While newspaper articles present the inconvenient consequences of this legislation and classify the proposed measures in categories which are familiar to the reader, the parliamentary debates open up new categories for practices known as mass surveillance and deny the existence of the latter. Let me assure you that this does not meet the criteria of doublethink...",

We've also seen increasing censorship of conversations between individuals, reflected by the blocks on chat networks like WhatsApp and Signal.\r\n\r\nOONI, the Open Observatory of Network Interference is a project for documenting and revealing these violations of Internet Connectivity. In 2017, we released mobile applications, reported on policy changes, expanded our testing to being detecting throttling, and now process close to 100,000 measurements from over 150 countries each month. We'll share how we're thinking about increasing transparency and accountability around the issues of access and censorship, and how you can join this growing, open, movement.",

But will this solve the Earth's problems in a peaceful way?", 
                                "description": "The increasing demand on energy seems to be one of the greatest challenges for modern society. [1,2] Power generation approaches of the 20th century, such as coal, oil, or nuclear plants come with certain issues limiting the scalability and/or questioning even the approach itself since they may harm nature and environment on a longterm time scale. [3]\r\nRenewable energy generated e.g. with solar cells, wind mills, or tidal stations are on the rise but they usually depend to certain locations, weather, storage capabilities, and in some cases even on political climates. [4]\r\nSpace based Solar Power generation [5,6] overcomes some of these issues: solar cells in orbit are independent of atmospheric influences and weather (e.g. clouds), solar harvesting satellites can be placed in orbit so they always face sun and generate power continuously, and there is enough space to scale the plants in order to serve the power demands. Solar power is an infinite power source (at least in the time scale for humanity) \r\nThe bottle neck with this approach, however, is the transfer of the power from orbit to Earth. But if solved, this technology can supply power to locations on Earth, that are remotely located, that lack other power generation capabilities (e.g. due to a natural catastrophe), or that come with varying demands on power consumption. \r\nSome questions still remain: Is it possible to transfer power wireless over such a long distance with a sufficient efficiency? [7] How would that influence life on Earth? And who is in charge of the orbital death laser?!?\r\n\r\n[1] https://data.worldbank.org/indicator/EG.USE.ELEC.KH.PC\r\n[2]https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2017/aug/28/electricity-demand-in-southern-europe-to-soar-with-air-con-say-climate-scientists  (http://www.pnas.org/content/114/38/E7910)\r\n[3] ...\r\n[4] https://unearthed.greenpeace.org/2015/12/23/three-problems-transitioning-renewables-how-to-fix/     \r\n[5] https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space-based_solar_power \r\n[6] https://www.nasa.gov/directorates/spacetech/niac/mankins_sps_alpha.html\r\n[7] https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wireless_power_transfer\r\n",

In this talk we will explain the physical foundations, give an overview of the current status and show you how to build an experimental system by yourself: it involves hacking an off-the-shelf model aircraft and its autopilot based on the open and free Ardupilot framework.", 
                                "description": "It is hard to argue that energy is not the very heart of humankind\u2019s major challenge. Up to now it is largely unscratched by a digital revolution -- the main power sources of the world are remarkably dumb.\r\n\r\nWe are about to change this. In this talk, we will present what we think will disrupt energy production. We're not talking about retrofitting the power grid with yet some more insecure 'smart' component. This is about predictably available renewable energy called Airborne Wind Energy (AWE): autonomous flying drones at high altitudes can harvest the wind\u2019s energy cheaper than any wind turbine, and most importantly: it can be done almost everywhere and almost all the time, solving the two major technological and geopolitical challenges of sustainable energy production, which has rattled the world for decades. We are convinced that humans should power the world by clean energy only, and we think AWE can be a key element to do just that. In this talk, we will cover the physical foundations, introduce a few of the control algorithms and the challenges associated with very strong forces acting on very light objects. We will also shed a light on the progress of leaders in the field such as Ampyx Power and Google Makani.\r\n \r\nBut there is more to it: Using the `AWEsome' project, we will show you how to build an open source wind drone for yourself by hacking a model plane and its autopilot based on the open and free Ardupilot framework. While its energy production will be rather limited, it serves a lot of useful purposes: For example, it paves the way to test crazy new ideas of start, landing and flight modes on a cheap disposable platform and is a training playground for flight operations.\r\n\r\nMaybe by the time of the next Chaos Communication Camp, you will have joined us and we can fly our wind energy harvesting robots together -- and save the world, all at the same time.",

To connect with the environment, for instance, do we need to connect with how it feels? This talk draws on works exploring both the marine environment and food, using knowledge from science, art, culture, instinct and history to create happenings and instances that break out the border of \"me\" and \"my environment\" to create an empathic response linking what we traditionally consider to be inside and outside. This will be demonstrated in the context of two artistic works - The Coral Empathy Device and Vital | Flows.", 
                                "description": "We exist within a set of rules about the value of knowledge - a hierarchy of knowledge that places quantified data at the top and the \u201clower\u201d senses at the bottom. The neglect of other forms of knowledge \u2013 aesthetic, embodied, cultural and more \u2013 has created a void in our socio-political and environmental relations that has been filled by emotive, populist rhetoric that undermines the validity of the knowledge we have. Post-truth practices are answering a gap that arises from our reliance on cognitive knowledge as the main valid form of knowledge \u2013 including datafication of everything \u2013 particularly in politics. \r\n\r\nAs an alternative I propose we augment this cognitive and data derived knowledge with more emotionally connecting knowledges, to achieve a more integrated understanding of the world, and to once again embark on a quest for a type of truth. \r\n\r\n\r\nWhen we live close to the land we experience empathy with the land. It has recently been said that indeed our present mode of life has led to the \u201cdeath of empathy\u201d. The Coral Empathy Device uses principles of embodied learning to explore whether physical sensation curated by an artist can evoke interspecies empathy in a human for a coral \u2013 a creature at once so similar and so alien to us. The artwork creates a discomforting experience that challenges the visitor\u2019s embodied experience to leverage the fact that \u201cthe body schema is the converting system of perception and action\u201d. By bridging the gap between the way we perceive and the way coral perceives, can we connect with the marine environment in a new way? Can we foster action by creating knowledge of another species within the body as a whole? \r\n\r\nVital | Flows is an ongoing work drawing knowledge about food from multiple sources - DIY science, phenomenology, instinct, culture - to explore the ephemeral nature of boundaries between self and other. This paper will report the results of open sourcing these methods, working with London communities who will use them to explore food and its meaning. This open source artistic research methodology for exploring environmental topics creates a platform for rhyzomic growth of selfactualised research that brings together and brings the best out of online and offline knowledge sharing. This is an exploration in breaking down the boundaries between inside and outside \"myself\", redefining the concept of the individual to incorporate the reality of our permeability. By achieving this through melding knowledge from quantification, embodiment, aesthetics and more, can we reach a new understanding of the place of self and other?",

                                "abstract": "The representation of thunderstorms (deep convection) and rain showers in climate models represents a major challenge, as this process is usually approximated with semi-empirical parameterizations due to the lack of appropriate computational resolution. Climate simulations using kilometer-scale horizontal resolution allow explicitly resolving deep convection and thus allow for an improved representation of the water cycle. We present a set of such simulations covering Europe and global computational domains. Finally, we discuss challenges and prospects climate modelers face on heterogeneous supercomputers architectures.", 
                                "description": "Today the evidence for global climate change is unequivocal, and the human influence is clear. Therefore the focus of young researchers has shifted from assessing whether the Planet is warming towards envisioning how a warmer world might look like. For instance, basic physical principles suggest that the hydrological cycle of Planet Earth will likely undergo dramatic changes. However, understanding and describing the involved processes, estimating future changes, and assessing the underlying uncertainties has proven to be difficult and complex. In this effort, numerical simulations of the weather and climate system are a useful research tool.\r\nWeather and climate modeling involves solving the governing equations of atmospheric motion on a numerical mesh and employing semi-empirical parameterizations that treat the processes not represented explicitly. For example, the parameterizations typically include treatments for thunderstorms and rain showers (deep convection). These processes are fundamental to the climate system since they vertically redistribute moisture, heat, and momentum, but so far they could not be resolved explicitly, due to the coarse gird spacing of the mesh (resolution) employed in the current generation of climate models. \r\nIn the recent year's power constrains in the domain of supercomputing have lead to heterogeneous node designs mixing conventional multi-core processors and accelerators such as graphics processing units (GPU\u2019s). These machines posses properties beneficial for weather and climate codes and hence allow refining the resolution of the involved computational mesh to the kilometer scale. Convective clouds can then be represented explicitly (convection-resolving) and the models can be formulated much closer to physical first principles. However, to exploit the capabilities of these supercomputers, model codes have to be ported, a challenging task the weather and climate modeling community is struggling with.\r\n\r\nWe discuss prospects and challenges climate modelers face on these new supercomputers and highlight the potential for addressing key open science questions. The presentation is illustrated with simulations recently accomplished using a new version of the Consortium for Small-Scale Modeling weather and climate model (COSMO), capable of exploiting these heterogeneous supercomputer architectures. Using results form a then-year-long climate simulation on a computational domain covering Europe (1536x1536x60 grid points) we highlight some of the added value of the approach regarding the representation of precipitation processes. Furthermore, we explore the gap between the currently established regional simulations and global simulations by scaling the GPU accelerated version of the COSMO model to a near-global computational domain.\r\nReferences:\r\nFuhrer, O., Chadha, T., Hoefler, T., Kwasniewski, G., Lapillonne, X., Leutwyler, D., L\u00fcthi, D., Osuna, C., Sch\u00e4r, C., Schulthess, T.

(2) There are social and economic networks of teleconnections spanning the globe. (3) It is dominated by planetary-scale social-ecological feedbacks.

                                "abstract": "In this talk, I address the question whether digitalization is likely to help decoupling economic growth from the environmental impacts of economic activities. In a first step, I summarize the literature on the impact of digitalization on growth and the environment. In a second step, I point out several concepts, in particular sufficiency, open source and commons, that may help to reconcile digitalization and environmental sustainability.", 
                                "description": "Digitalization is said to revolutionize not only industrial production but almost any aspect of our lives: Digital devices change the way we consume (online-shopping), we communicate (social media), our mobility forms (car and bike sharing, autonomous cars) and the way we organize our communities (smart cities). At the same time, environmental questions are barely discussed. There are mostly vague statements that industry 4.0 will make the economy more sustainable by increasing resource- and energy-efficiencies (Huber, 2013). However, in recent years a number of scientific investigations have shed more light on the issue. This talk summarizes these findings and thereby addresses the issue, whether digitalization can actually help to reduce the environmental impact of our economic activities. The central question is: Will the digitalization of our economy help to decouple economic growth and environmental impact?\r\nOne of the central promises of digitalization is economic growth. In Germany, the discourse on digitalization is driven by influential industries, who have come up with the term Industrie 4.0 (engl.: industry 4.0). It implies the application of new digital technologies in production processes, in particular to organize production with less human labor. In other words: It means to increase labor productivity. If this development is only half as revolutionary as promised, labor productivity will rise significantly. One possible scenario is that these increases in productivity are used for a new phase of economic growth. In case of full-time employment, large increases in labor productivity imply high growth in GDP. As Niko Paech (2017) and Tilman Santarius (2017) have argued, this puts the question of decoupling economic growth from environmental throughput back on the agenda.\r\nIt appears to be improbable that digitalization will allow for a sufficient decoupling under the economic regime that exists. As a reminder: The increases in resource-efficiency need to be speeded up from a current average of 1.5% to 4.4%, to reach climate goals. And even that would only keep us under 2 \u00b0C (and not 1.5 \u00b0C as recommended by many environmental scientists) to a probability of 66% (Antal & Bergh, 2016). But even if sufficient decoupling is unlikely, can it help to achieve at least absolute decoupling (that is, at least some absolute reductions in environmental impacts)?\r\nResearch so far shows a positive relationship between digitalization, energy use and economic growth. The (preliminary) analysis is that digitalization simultaneously leads to economic growth (as it leads to higher labor productivity) and to more energy use (because ICTs need energy to work) (Cardona, Kretschmer, & Strobel, 2013; Salahuddin & Alam, 2016). And even if it was possible to use digitalization to decouple economic growth from greenhouse gases: It would probably lead to other environmental problems, in particular regarding resource extraction (Pilgrim, Groneweg, & Reckordt, 2017).\r\nThis does not mean that digitalization has to be negative in general when it comes to environmental sustainability. The transition to 100% renewables is difficult to imagine without digital technologies (Zimmermann, Wolf, & Baum, 2016). And digitalization opens up many opportunities to increase resource- und energy efficiencies. However, the current economic structure, including its continuous generation of economic growth, countervails such positive features. \r\nThe question is therefore, how to use the opportunities of digitalization while preventing its adverse environmental effects. A key concept is sufficiency. It is well-known in environmental sciences. Sufficiency implies that new technologies are combined with new patterns of individual behaviour, in order to achieve better environmental results (Jenny, 2014). Sufficiency can also be applied to digitalization, in particular regarding the design of information and communication technologies and concerning the data-intensity of software. However, designs of hardware and software are tightly related to the question, who develops them and for what purpose. Here, the concepts of commons (Helfrich & Bollier, 2012), open source (Gibb, 2014) and collaborative platforms (Scholz, 2016) may be good starting points to steer towards a type of digitalization that is truly sustainable. \r\n\r\n\u2003\r\nBibliography\r\nAntal, M., & Bergh, J.

It has been years since any modern servers have supported Free Firmware options like LinuxBIOS or coreboot, and as a result server and cloud security has been dependent on unreviewable, closed source, proprietary vendor firmware of questionable quality.  With Heads on NERF, we are making it possible to take back control of our systems with Open Source Software from very early in the boot process, helping build a more trustworthy and secure cloud.", 
                                "description": "The NERF project was started by Ron Minnich (author of LinuxBIOS and lead of coreboot at Google) in January 2017 with the goal to bring Linux back to the BIOS by retaining a minimal set of PEI modules for memory controller initialization and replacing the entirety of the server vendor's UEFI DXE firmware with a reproducibly built Linux runtime.  It has been ported to a few different manufacturer's servers, demonstrating the general portability of the concept.\r\n\r\nNERF is fast - less than twenty second boot times, versus multiple minutes.  It's flexible - it can make use of any devices, filesystems and protocols that Linux supports. And it's open - users can easily customize the boot scripts, fix issues, build their own runtimes and reflash their firmware with their own keys.\r\n\r\nThe Heads runtime was started by Trammell Hudson (author of Thunderstrike and Magic Lantern) and was presented last year at 33c3.  It is a slightly more secure bootloader that uses Linux, the TPM, GPG and kexec to be able to load, measure, verify and execute the real kernel.  As part of porting Heads to work with NERF on server platforms, it now includes tools like Keylime to allow severs to remotely attest to user controlled systems that the NERF/Heads firmware matches what they expect, as well as network and iSCSI drivers for diskless compute node servers.\r\n\r\nIn this talk we'll provide an overview of the NERF project, the currently supported server mainboards, and the continued development on the Heads runtime that allows more trust in the servers that make up the cloud.",

Net neutrality also guarantees equal access to the global Internet to all ideas, innovations and opinions without centralised control.\r\n\r\nSince August 2016, the EU has had a regulatory regime protecting net neutrality that now has to be enforced by the national telecoms' regulatory authorities. Unfortunately, we observe very different results in different EU member states with Germany presenting a particularly negative example. In this context, our NGO epicenter.works has focused its enforcement work on a product of Deutsche Telekom called \"StreamOn\". We will showcase our work on that product analysing the offer, raising awareness, submitting complaints with the regulator, and speaking at the annual general meeting of Deutsche Telekom AG.\r\n\r\nThis presentation is intended for everyone interested in net neutrality and particularly for those that want to become active in safeguarding it.",

It is a form of biotechnical civil disobedience, seeking to subvert dominant biopolitical agents of hormonal management, knowledge production, and anthropogenic toxicity. The project begins with a speculative question: what if it was possible to make estrogen in the kitchen? From this seed arises more fundamental questions about who is producing hormones, whose bodies are affected, and how environmental hormones exist already as a state of toxicity. While issues of body and gender sovereignty are deeply at stake, endocrine disruptors termed \u2018xenoestrogens\u2019 pervade our environments due to petrochemical agro-industrial and pharmaceutical forces. These xeno-molecules change the morphology of our bodies and bodies of non-human species, evidencing a malleability inherent to nature but alien to our prescribed notions of (eco)heteronormalcy. In response to the \u201cmolecular queering\u201d performed by estrogen, facilitated by dominant hegemonic forces, the project initiates a public dialogue through DIY/DIWO (do-it-yourself/do-it-with-others) biohacking and artistic intervention. Using speculative design, iterative workshopping, and kitchen performance, Open Source Estrogen employs these tactics to create new subjectivities for living in an increasingly queer world. From capitalist xeno-forces arise xeno-solidarities, capable of collectively hacking the systems of hormonal colonization.",

Looking from the mobile telecommunications side, at the moment it's possible to run your own GSM or UMTS network using a transmit capable SDR device and free software like OsmoBTS or OpenBTS. There is also the srsLTE project, which provides open source implementation of LTE base station (eNodeB) and moreover the client side stack (srsUE) for SDR. Our talk is about the R&D process of porting the existing GSM mobile side stack (OsmocomBB) to the SDR based hardware, and about the results we have achieved.",

One could be used for different purposes, including education and research. The problem is that the SDR platforms were out of the hardware the project could work on. The primary supported hardware for now are old Calypso based phones (mostly Motorola C1XX).\r\n\r\nDespite they are designed to act as mobile phone, there are still some limitations, such as the usage of proprietary firmware for DSP (Digital Signal Processor), which is being managed by the OsmocomBB software, and lack of GPRS support. Moreover, these phones are not manufactured anymore, so it's not so easy to find them nowadays.\r\n\r\nTaking the known problems and limitations into account, and having a strong desire to give everyone the new possibilities for research and education in the telecommunications scope, we decided to write a 'bridge' between OsmocomBB and SDR. Using GNU Radio, a well known environment for signal processing, we have managed to get some interesting results, which we would like to share with community on the upcoming CCC.",

This project initiated by the hardware lab at Shenkar College of Arts and Tel Aviv Makerspace consists from series of workshops, in which participants combine simple circuits (lickometer with LED, vibration motor or piezo) with recipes for candy making (hard candy based on syrups or gummy or corn starch molds). The circuits are casted in candy \u201cmolds\u201d to serve different ideas defined by the participants: extreme hardware fetishist lollipops, philosophical props into sensory perception, post-colonial critique of the sugar cane addiction and slavery, scientific interest in triggering taste buds etc. This probe into the edible hardware is also a celebration of the DIY culture of sharing behind cooking, but also Open Source Hardware that bridges the divisions between the kitchen, the hardware studio and the science lab. Instead of applying science and technology to cooking and tasting (typical for molecular gastronomy & haute cuisine), the electroedibles use the experiences of candy cooking and to engage with different science and technology issues in enjoyable and funny ways.",

Up to now, DNA fingerprinting  in forensic settings may, in addition to non-coding features of DNA, only analyze the chromosomal sex of the person, but not any other openly visible feature. Bavaria and Baden-Wurttemberg, under the leadership of CSU and the Green party, are pushing forward to analyze DNA found at crime scenes regarding hair color, eye color, skin color and in the case of Bavaria even geographical ethnicity. Extended DNA analysis, or \u201cDNA facial composite\u201d  is seen as an impartial witness to the crime and, in the eyes of the states\u2019 government, would help solve crimes. But would it?", 
                                "description": "Ever since TV shows such as CSI or NCIS have become popular, DNA evidence has gained a reputation for an infallible method of crime solving. However, similar to fingerprints, DNA evidence up to now only serves as a method of matching the DNA at a crime scene to a suspect. So what if there are no suspects? In theory, DNA possesses all the information on what a human being would look like. Does that mean we could construct a facial composite from blood spots, semen or saliva? While the term \u201cDNA facial composite\u201d may imply so, the science of it is still in its infancy. We can determine a likely eye, hair and skin color and a geographic ethnicity from the DNA. In some cases even more features. This could, depending on the case, lead investigations to the right suspect - but down a very dangerous path. \r\nGenetic information is subject to the laws of privacy. For one, instead of having a crime and finding as suspect, extended DNA analysis leads to an investigation into a crime, where there is no suspect, but a range of \u201cnon-suspect persons of interest\u201d that are connected to the case only by their appearance. The presumption of innocence is vital to a democracy. Putting people of similar appearance \u2013 or even ethnical groups \u2013 into the focus of investigation, is likely to spark even more xenophobic movements in Germany.  Information on skin color correlates with medical information such as skin cancer risk, but also risk for heart disease. This medical information is especially protected by law. What is worse, the technology could lead investigations to the wrong \u201cnon-suspect person of interest\u201d. Just as hair color may change with age, so may for instance the appearance of a person\u2019s gender. Not all genetic information is directly seen in the phenotype. Adding up to this, the data correlating genes to geographic ethnicity is only as good as the data of people who have contributed to the database in the first place.\r\nIf DNA analysis is to be implemented in Germany \u2013 and it very well might be \u2013 we need to push for hard data protection laws and strict rules when and where it may be applied. \r\n",

From a physicist's perspective, wireless radiation is just light, to be precise: coherent electromagnetic radiation. It is virtually the same as the beam of a laser, except that its wavelength is much longer (cm vs \u00b5m). \r\n\r\nWe have developed a way to visualize this radiation, providing a view of the world as it would look like for eyes sensitive to wireless radiation. \r\n\r\nOur scheme is based on holography, a technique to record three-dimensional pictures by a phase-coherent recording of radiation in a two-dimensional plane. This technique is traditionally implemented using laser light. We have adapted it to work with wireless radiation, and recorded holograms of building interiors illuminated by the omnipresent stray field of wireless devices. In the resulting three-dimensional images we can see both emitters (appearing as bright spots) and absorbing objects (appearing as shadows in the beam). Our scheme does not require any knowledge of the data transmitted and works with arbitrary signals, including encrypted communication. \r\n\r\nThis result has several implications: it could provide a way to track wireless emitters in buildings, it could provide a new way for through-wall imaging of building infrastructure like water and power lines. As these applications are available even with encrypted communication, it opens up new questions about privacy.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n",

In contrast, activities like testing, debugging, and code review are accepted as essential.  They are woven into the lives of nearly all developers.  In this talk, I will explain how I see machine-checked proofs enabling new everyday activities for developers of computer software and hardware.  These activities have the potential to lower development effort dramatically, at the same time as they increase our assurance that systems behave correctly and securely.  I will give a cosmological overview of this field, answering the FAQs that seem to stand in the way of practicality; and I will illustrate the principles with examples from projects that you can clone from GitHub today, covering the computing stack from digital hardware design to cryptographic software and applications.", 
                                "description": "<p>Today's developers of computer software and hardware are tremendously effective, compared to their predecessors.  We have found very effective ways of <b>modularizing</b> and <b>validating</b> our work.  The talk is about ammunition for these activities from a perhaps-unexpected source.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><b>Modularity</b> involves breaking a complex system into a hierarchy of simpler pieces, which may be written and understood separately.  Structured programming (e.g., using loops and conditionals instead of <tt>goto</tt>s) helps us read and understand parts of a single function in isolation, and data abstraction lets us encapsulate important functionality in objects, with guarantees that other code can only access the private data by calling public methods.  That way, we can convince ourselves that the encapsulated code upholds certain essential properties, <i>regardless of which other code it is linked with</i>.  Systematic unit testing also helps enforce contracts for units of modularity.  Each of these techniques can be rerun automatically, to catch regressions in evolving systems, and catch those regressions in a way that accurately points the finger of responsibility to particular modules.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><b>Validation</b> is an important part of development that encompasses testing, debugging, code review, and anything else that we do to raise our confidence that the system behaves as intended.  Experienced engineers know that validation tends to take up the majority of engineering effort.  Often that effort involves mentally taxing activities that would not otherwise come up in coding.  One example is thinking about test-case coverage, and another is including instrumentation that produces traces to consult during debugging.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>It is not hard for working developers to imagine great productivity gains from better ways to break systems into pieces or raise our confidence in those pieces.  The claim I will make in this talk is that a key source of such insights has been neglected: <b>machine-checked mathematical proofs</b>.  Here the basic functionality is an ASCII language for defining mathematical objects, stating theorems about them, and giving proofs of theorems.  Crucially, an algorithm checks that purported proofs really do establish the theorems.  By going about these activities in the style of programming, we inherit usual supporting tools like IDEs, version control, continuous integration, and automated build processes.  But how could so esoteric a task as math proofs call for that kind of tooling, and what does it have to do with building real computer systems?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I will explain a shared vision to that end, developed along with many other members of my research community.  Let me try to convince you that all of the following goals are attainable in the next 10 years.</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n  <li>We will have complete computer systems implementing moderately complex network servers for popular protocols, <i>proved to implement those protocols correctly, from the level of digital circuits on up</i>.  We will remove all deployed code (hardware or software) from the trusted computing base, shifting our trust to much smaller specifications and proof checkers.</li>\r\n  <li>Hobbyists will be able to design new embedded computing platforms by mixing and matching open-source hardware and software components, also mixing and matching <i>the proofs</i> of these components, <i>guaranteeing no bugs at the digital-abstraction level or higher</i>, with <i>no need for debugging</i>.</li>\r\n  <li>New styles of library design will be enabled by the chance to attach a <i>formal behavioral specification</i> to each library.  For instance, rank-and-file programmers will able to assemble their own code for cryptographic protocols, with code that looks like reference implementations in Python, but <i>getting performance comparable to what experts handcraft in assembly today</i>.  Yet that benefit would come with <i>no need to trust that library authors have avoided bugs or intentional backdoors</i>, perhaps even including <i>automatic proofs of cryptographic security properties</i>.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p>Main technical topics to cover to explain my optimism:</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n  <li>The basic functionality of <i>proof assistants</i> and why we should trust their conclusions</li>\r\n  <li>How to think about system decomposition with specifications and proofs, including why, for most components, we do not need to worry about specification mistakes</li>\r\n  <li>The different modes of applying proof technology to check or generate components</li>\r\n  <li>The engineering techniques behind cost-effective proof authoring for realistic systems</li>\r\n  <li>A hardware case study: <a href=\"https://github.com/mit-plv/kami\">Kami</a>, supporting component-based digital hardware authoring with proofs</li>\r\n  <li>A software case study: <a href=\"https://github.com/mit-plv/fiat-crypto\">Fiat Cryptography</a>, supporting correct-by-construction auto-generation of fast code for elliptic-curve cryptography</li>\r\n  <li>Pointers to where to look next, if you would like to learn more about this technology</li>\r\n</ul>",

These included websites informing about the referendum and information about the polling station each citizen had to use. I will describe how the censorship got circumvented and give an insight in the systems developed to facilitate an easy cloning of the information.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nOn the day of the referendum it was expected that the Spanish police will close down polling stations. Therefor a global census accessible via internet was introduced which allowed the vote at any polling station. I will describe how this global census was organised to block people from voting twice. I will explain in which different ways the census got attacked by the Spanish state. And of course what we can learn from the state censorship to create more resilient infrastructures.\r\n</p>",

To realize this complex orchestration, avatar\u00b2 enables communication and state synchronization between a variety of popular tools, such as Qemu, OpenOCD, GDB, PANDA and angr.\r\n\r\nWhile the declared scope of avatar\u00b2 the is analysis of embedded firmware, this talk will also show that the framework can also be useful in other contexts, such as scripting gdb in python from outside gdb, or loading the state of a concretely executed binary into angr.",

We present alternative anonymisation communication networks which achieve different goals with different methods.

Auch r\u00fcckblickend ist dies in Anbetracht von Repression und Umgang mit Polizeigewalt ein augenscheinliches Problem. Eine Auseinandersetzung mit den Themen, die beim Gipfel verhandelt werden oder werden sollten, findet in der Regel nicht statt oder verliert sich im Rausch des Spektakels. Sowohl der mangelnden Qualit\u00e4t und der Behinderung von Berichterstattung, als auch dem Fehlen einer verst\u00e4ndlichen Auseinandersetzung mit den politischen Inhalten dieses \"Festivals der Demokratie\" wollten wir etwas entgegensetzen.\r\n<b>Proposal</b>\r\nIm Talk m\u00f6chten wir aus unterschiedlichen Perspektiven von unseren Erfahrungen berichten. Von technischen H\u00fcrden, von Arbeit in Gruppenstrukturen, von Organisation, Schwierigkeiten und Erfolgen:\r\nAls FC/MC (mit gro\u00dfem Aufgebot an Infrastruktur und Raum im Herzen von Hamburg) und als TINT (mit einem schwimmenden Studio auf einem Hamburger Kanal und den Relays bis in die Sperrgebiete)\r\nEs geht darum ein verst\u00e4ndliches Bild zu zeichnen von dem, was in Hamburg w\u00e4hrend und vor dem Gipfel bei uns passiert ist und erreicht wurde. Zum anderen um Erkenntnisse f\u00fcr die Zukunft: Was hat es gebracht und wie k\u00f6nnen, sollten und wollen wir weiter machen? Dabei wollen wir besonders die Fruchtbarkeit von Kollaborationen dieser Art, in unserem Fall zwischen Aktivist_innen, K\u00fcnstler_innen und Hacker_innen unterstreichen.",

She makes electromechanical sound installations, drawings, audio-visual works, how-to videos and experimental performances with handmade electronics. Through deconstruction and experimentation with failed and obsolete technology, her work demystifies hidden systems within machines as a way to trace-out structures of economy, power and control embedded throughout capitalist culture.",

                                "description": "Despite the dense and controversial history of psychedelics, since around 2000 in Europe and United States researchers have reopened investigations into the potential therapeutic applications of these drugs. However, today a variety of psychedelic uses exist both within and outside of medicine. According to numerous press reports, in Rolling Stones, Wired Magazine, Vice, Marie Claire, The Economist, Forbes, The Washington Post, The Guardian and many other journals, Microdosing Psychedelics appears to gain in popularity within different social spheres, especially in professional fields such as informatics and information technologies. It is also supported for its therapeutic dimension, as we can see it in the book of the lawyer and novelist Ayelet Waldman, A Really Good Day, who explains that microdosing helped her to recover from a depression, and, finally, according to the data collected up till now by the psychologist James Fadiman or the information on current scientific research provided by the association The Third Wave. From a comprehensive and non-evaluative sociological perspective, this self-organized session will be dedicated to the current variety of (non-) therapeutic uses of psychedelics, and will aim to share experiences and opinions related to the theme of microdosing psychedelics.",

Kinder ab 10 Jahren, die gerne ihre eigenen let's Plays erstellen m\u00f6chten! Maximal 4-6 Kids, ausser wir bekommen noch Helfer! Wir gehen davon aus das Kids ihre eigene Ger\u00e4te mitbringen! Bisher haben wir den Workshop immer auf Laptops geprobt!\n\nDie Software kann unter folgenden Quellen geladen und anschlie\u00dfend installiert werden:\n\n* Screenrecording Software https://obsproject.com/ (Linux,OSX und Windows)\n* Freie Bildbearbeitungssoftware https://www.gimp.org/ (Linux,OSX und Windows)\n\n'''Achtung!''' F\u00fcr die Installation wird ein Administratorenpasswort des Rechners ben\u00f6tigt.\n\n\nNat\u00fcrlich darf bei jeder Session auch begeistert zugesehen werden und wer kein ad\u00e4quates Ger\u00e4t dabei  hat wird sicher auch einmal die M\u00f6glichkeit bekommen zu spielen!\nDie Anmeldung erfolgt vor Ort und falls die Zeit im Jugendhack Assembly abgelaufen ist finden wir mit Sicherheit noch eine ecke im Kidspace wo wir nach Lust und Laune weiter experimentieren k\u00f6nnen!",

With some colleagues, we have studied how we could use debug components available in most ARM processors to create security mechanisms targeting a wide range of attacks (buffer overflows, ROPs\u2026) with minimal performance overheads.\r\nWe use CoreSight debug components in with a technique called dynamic information flow tracking (aka DIFT) which allow us to monitor the execution of an application at runtime. Compared to existing works, we show that there\u2019s no need to modify the main processor (existing binaries will be compatible!). Furthermore, we used a coprocessor implemented in reconfigurable logic (FPGA chip) to speedup the DIFT process.\r\nThis ARM/FPGA combo is up to 90% faster than related techniques in terms of instrumentation time. Furthermore, as the ARM CPU has not been modified (while existing works do modify it\u2026), the final user doesn\u2019t have to recompile all his/her programs to be compatible with our approach.\r\nWe will also show a few clues to indicate how we could target multi-threaded/multi-processor architectures as it is the case of most embedded systems by now.\r\n",

How do we get most out of this opportunity?",

Finally, I would like to do a call to action, nationally and internationally.\r\nThe main concerns about the law are: the allowance of untargeted interception on a potentially massive scale. (Which the AIVD is framing as not being mass-surveillance, you judge for yourself.) This sparked an outcry from human rights activists, journalists, doctors, and others. Also, the hacking of third-parties is very uncool and has not yet been the subject of a strong public debate.\r\nBoth edges of the political spectrum are supporting the initiative, which shows how the erosion of privacy affects us all. Thus, our campaign tries to reach out to everyone. Now that the privacy debate is mainstream and #woke again, Team-Intelligence-Agencies is showing their teeth. But we\u2019re biting back, even though we realize that we are five kids (and back-up) fighting something way bigger than ourselves. This means that we really need your support! You can help on so many levels that I won\u2019t write them down, so I guess you should come see this talk.",

The story that emerges is an inspiring view of what communities can (and can\u2019t) accomplish in the face of adversity.\r\n", 
                                "description": "Internet access in Cuba is a study in resilience. By the official numbers, the island seems hopelessly disconnected: Cuba ranked last in the Americas in the ITU\u2019s 2016 ICT development index, having only 5.6% household Internet penetration, and international bandwidth per user measures a mere 572 bits/s. Yet Cubans have developed a number of bottom-up, community-oriented responses to these limitations.\r\n\r\nThis talk will focus on three indigenous networks that aren't seen by the typical tourist. These include \u201cEl Paquete\u201d, a sneaker-net distribution of media files that\u2019s passed around the country on USB sticks and hard drives, and which may be Cuba\u2019s largest source of private employment. There is also the Cuban educational network, which connects more than 20 higher education institutions around the country. Perhaps most unusual is Havana\u2019s \u201cStreet Network\u201d, or SNET, a vast unsanctioned IP network, constructed by volunteers using salvaged equipment. Though entirely isolated from the Internet, the SNET connects over 50,000 residential users across the capital city, and it\u2019s home to a vibrant community and hundreds of websites.\r\n\r\nIn describing these three systems, we'll draw lessons about what is necessary for network communities to survive and thrive in the island\u2019s challenging environment, including places where flexibility and compromise have been essential. Cuba presents a highly unusual regulatory and technological environment, and the approaches that have succeeded there are both inspiring and demonstrative of what communities can (and can't) accomplish through organic, distributed networks.",

Less advanced states even block the entire internet nation-wide.\r\n\r\nWe need to develop tools that are more resilient to these threats. Communication and expression needs to be free. Censorship should not be possible. Even if the internet was taken down, people should still be able to communicate.\r\n\r\nThis presentation will introduce Briar a resilient messaging app. Its goal is to enable people in any country to create safe spaces where they can debate any topic, plan events, and organize social movements.\r\n\r\nBriar does not rely on servers. It connects people directly peer-to-peer and does not care how data is exchanged. Currently, it has plugins for Bluetooth, WiFi and Tor. The latter is used for long-distance communication over the internet and is supposed to not leak metadata.\r\n\r\nBriar aims to be secure and easy to use at the same time. An Android app is currently in beta. Support for other platforms is planned.\r\n\r\nSince Briar works peer-to-peer, there is no single universal truth in it. Each group of people might have a different view on the available data depending on their connectivity. This opens up some interesting technical and usability problems that you do not encounter in centralized systems where the server is the authority.",

An erroneous tip called into law enforcement authorities in 2002 subjected Elahi to an intensive investigation by the FBI and after undergoing months of interrogations, he was finally cleared of suspicions. After this harrowing experience, Elahi conceived \u201cTracking Transience\u201d and opened just about every aspect of his life to the public. Predating the NSA\u2019s PRISM surveillance program by half a decade, the project questions the consequences of living under constant surveillance and continuously generates databases of imag- ery that tracks the artist and his points of transit in real-time. Although initially created for his FBI agent, the public can also monitor the artist\u2019s communication records, banking transactions, and transportation logs along with various intelligence and government agencies who have been confirmed visiting his website.

Digitalisate historischer Gem\u00e4lde, Zeichnungen, B\u00fccher, Zeitschriften, Handschriften, Karten, Schriftrollen, Fotografien und Archivmaterialien online bereitzustellen, macht es m\u00f6glich, deren Inhalte ortsunabh\u00e4ngig und bei optimalem Schutz der physisch empfindlichen Originale gro\u00dfen Nutzerkreisen zur Verf\u00fcgung zu stellen. Dies wird durch neue Standards wie IIIF nun auch maschinenlesbar m\u00f6glich.\r\n\r\nWar bis vor wenigen Jahren die Betrachtung dieser Werke nur auf isolierten, institutionellen Websites m\u00f6glich, so besch\u00e4ftigt sich seit 2011 eine wachsende internationale Gemeinschaft von Forschungsbibliotheken, Museen und Archiven mit der Konzeption und Standardisierung einer interoperablen Technologie zur institutions\u00fcbergreifenden Bereitstellung von Digitalisaten im Internet unter der Bezeichnung International Image Interoperability Framework (IIIF, http://iiif.io).\r\n\r\nAufgrund seiner starken Orientierung an Linked Open Data und der interoperablen Bereitstellung aller Ressourcen \u00fcber HTTP ist es mit IIIF m\u00f6glich, Daten zu verkn\u00fcpfen und virtuelle Arbeitsumgebungen zu realisieren, die Digitalisate von Servern unterschiedlicher Einrichtungen unter einer Oberfl\u00e4che vereinen. So ist es beispielsweise m\u00f6glich, Werke, die sich an v\u00f6llig unterschiedlichen Orten weltweit befinden, in einer IIIF-basierten Oberfl\u00e4che virtuell nebeneinander zu legen, sie zu betrachten und mit ihnen zu arbeiten. Dabei erm\u00f6glicht IIIF auch das Anlegen und Weitergeben von Annotationen, die ebenfalls nach dem Prinzip von Linked Data modelliert sind. IIIF kann die Grundlage f\u00fcr institutions\u00fcbergreifende wissenschaftliche Arbeitsumgebungen sein.\r\n\r\nDer Talk soll in IIIF allgemein einf\u00fchren, sowie konkrete Datenquellen und Anwendungen vorstellen. Der Talk wird viele anschauliche Beispiele enthalten, die Werke von internationaler Bedeutung einbeziehen. Zugleich will der Talk auch einladen, an der Weiterentwicklung dieser neuen Standards und Technologien mitzuwirken, sowie IIIF-kompatible Open Source Anwendungen zu entwerfen oder weiterzuentwickeln.\r\n\r\nLeander Seige ist Bereichsleiter f\u00fcr Digitale Dienste der Universit\u00e4tsbibliothek Leipzig, hat dort, neben vielen anderen Open Source-basierten IT-Infrastrukturprojekten, auch IIIF als neue Standardtechnologie zur Bereitstellung von Digitalisaten eingef\u00fchrt. Die Universit\u00e4tsbibliothek Leipzig bewahrt eine der gr\u00f6\u00dften Altbestandssammlungen in Deutschland mit einem breiten Spektrum historischer Materialien, die nach und nach per IIIF bereitgestellt werden, bevorzugt unter CC0. Leander Seige engagiert sich darin, IIIF auch in Kooperationsprojekten mit anderen Einrichtungen zu etablieren.

Immediately after taking office, the Trump administration issued two executive orders pumping resources into border and immigration enforcement agencies, heightening fears of deportation, harassment, and family separation among immigrant communities. In the following months reports emerged of increased immigration enforcement activity and hints about the deployment of new high-tech methods by the immigration enforcement agency. I will discuss the current state of immigration enforcement in the US and associated surveillance capabilities, the results of a study with undocumented immigrants about their technology practices, and the takeaways for the technology and privacy community in supporting communities of heightened risk.", 
                                "description": "In this talk, I will first discuss the current state of immigration enforcement in the United States, including recent immigration policy changes, known surveillance capabilities of enforcement agencies, and recent efforts by these agencies that hint at an expansion of technical sophistication. I will then discuss lessons and insights from a series of interviews we conducted with undocumented immigrants and immigrant rights organizations about this community\u2019s technology practices, risk awareness, and security and privacy behavior online. We find that in the face of acute risk of detention, harassment, and deportation, this community is well-versed in managing risks offline. Their most common strategies for managing risk online\u2014self-censorship and controlling access to spaces\u2014are largely the same techniques used in the physical world. However, the immigrants we interviewed are extremely uncertain about the effectiveness of their defenses against adversaries online, which are typically conceptualized as nebulous and all-knowing.\r\n\r\nWe find that managing privacy and immigration status disclosure, a responsibility that rests not only with individuals but in communities, is more complex online. This is in part due to a diminishing sense of control online over where and how information is exposed. Furthermore, this community places a surprising amount of trust in the platforms that host their community spaces, which exposes a potentially dangerous gap in understanding about information collection and use by companies. Based on our findings, I will discuss what technologists, security tool developers, and activists should be aware of in order to more effectively support communities of heightened risk in protecting themselves online.

                                "abstract": "Type confusion, often combined with use-after-free, is the main attack vector to compromise modern C++ software like browsers or virtual machines. Typecasting is a core principle that enables modularity in C++. For performance, most typecasts are only checked statically, i.e., the check only tests if a cast is allowed for the given type hierarchy, ignoring the actual runtime type of the object. Using an object of an incompatible base type instead of a derived type results in type confusion. Attackers have been abusing such type confusion issues to compromise popular software products including Adobe Flash, PHP, Google Chrome, or Firefox, raising critical security concerns.\r\n\r\nWe discuss the details of this vulnerability type and how such vulnerabilities relate to memory corruption. Based on an LLVM-based sanitizer that we developed, we will show how to discover such vulnerabilities in large software through fuzzing and how to protect yourself against this class of bugs.", 
                                "description": "C++ is popular in large software projects that require both the modularity of object-oriented programming and the high efficiency offered by low-level access to memory and system intrinsics. Examples of such software are Google Chrome, Microsoft Windows, Mozilla Firefox, or Oracle's JVM.  Unfortunately, C++ enforces neither type nor memory safety. This lack of safety leads to type confusion vulnerabilities that can be abused to attack programs.  Type confusion arises when the program interprets an object of one type as an object of a different type due to unsafe typecasting, leading to reinterpretation of memory areas in different contexts.  For instance, a program may cast an instance of a parent class to a descendant class, even though this is not safe if the parent class lacks some of the fields or virtual functions of the descendant class. When the program subsequently uses these fields or functions, it may use data, say, as a regular field in one context and as a virtual function table (vtable) pointer in another. Exploitable type confusion bugs have been found in a wide range of software products, such as Adobe Flash (CVE-2015-3077), Microsoft Internet Explorer (CVE-2015-6184), PHP (CVE-2016-3185), and Google Chrome (CVE-2013-0912). According to Microsoft, type confusion is the 4th most common vulnerability type in their bug bounty program (after use-after-free, memory corruption, and heap out-of-bounds read) with the majority of type confusion bugs also fitting into one of the earlier categories.\r\n\r\nWe have developed an extension to the Clang/LLVM compiler that detects type-confusion bugs with low overhead and high coverage. Our prototype consists of two parts: an object tracing facility and typecasting verification. Such an enforcement mechanism is useful as a runtime monitor and online defense mechanism to protect applications against attacks. In a development setting, the mechanism can be combined with a fuzzing framework to detect type confusion before the underlying memory corruption triggers.\r\n\r\nIn this talk we will first discuss how type safety protects against type confusion-based attacks. We will then introduce our prototype implementation and show how it actively defeats realistic attacks. Finally, we show how to leverage type safety in a fuzzing framework to find security vulnerabilities faster.  We will release all components as open-source.\r\n\r\nWe introduce the concept of a type sanitizer that checks all casts in an application (replacing static casts with fully explicit runtime checks) and show how we have developed a low-overhead framework for these checks. Building on this framework we argue that it can be used as a runtime monitor in an always on configuration to protect users against attacks and how developers, security researchers, and hackers can use it to find new vulnerabilities in real software.\r\n\r\nThe expected audience includes people interested in system software, reverse engineering, fuzzing, type confusion-based attacks, and memory corruption-based attacks and their defense mechanisms. General programming and low-level knowledge is expected but the talk will be self contained and does not expect the audience to know the upcoming defense mechanisms or attacks.",

                                "description": "Blockchain holds a big promise for Public Key Infrastructure (PKI) designs. Prominent systems, such as Keybase and CONIKS, tend to be centralized, something that eases the update of keys and provides good availability. Centralized designs, however, require users to trust that the source of authority acts honestly at all times, and does not perform surveillance.<br>\r\n\r\nClaimChain is a decentralized PKI design, where users maintain repositories of claims implemented as hash chains: data structures that allow for efficient verification of the integrity and authenticity of their content. Claims relate to the key material of the owners, or their beliefs about public keys of others. In the latter case, cross-referencing serves as a way of efficient and verifiable vouching about states of other users. In practice, such information would reveal the social graph of the chain owners and even their communication patterns. To solve this privacy issue, we use cryptographic verifiable random functions to derive private identifiers that are re-randomized on each chain update, encrypted to a given set of authorized readers. In that way, chain owners can not present different views to authorized readers of the same contact. ClaimChain allows to detect chain compromises, manifested as forks of hash chains, and to implement various social policies for deriving decisions about the latest state of users in the system.<br>\r\n\r\nEvaluation of a prototype implementation indicates that ClaimChain can scale to accommodate the needs of large groups at an acceptable computational and bandwidth overhead cost. Interoperability with PGP makes it possible for users to gradually deploy ClaimChain locally. Email providers that wish to adopt ClaimChain will participate as an additional factor in the social authentication process. Arguably, ClaimChain constitutes an example that decentralization in combination with modern cryptography allow for increased robustness to adversarial central authorities, and offer comparable availability, as well as more options for supporting privacy.",

                                "description": "Master Quality Authenticated (MQA) is an audio format introduced in 2014 promising to deliver studio sound at home.\r\n\r\nMarketed aggressively mostly to audiophiles two claims are central to MQA: no DRM and better sound through \u201cdeblurring temporal inaccuracies\u201d introduced by ADCs and DACs in the signal chain.\r\n\r\nMQA is backed by the three major labels Warner, Universal and Sony and has support by a number of indie label rights agencies as well as by the Recording Industry Association of America. \r\n\r\nRollout has started in 2016 and at IFA 2017 the major labels asserted their backing for the format. Streaming services Tidal, Deezer and Pandora as well as Groovers (Korea) 7digital and HDmusicstream offer MQA-streaming at a higher price-point as their regular offerings (20.- per month instead of 10).\r\n\r\nCompanies like Onkyo, Pioneer, Sony, Rotel and NAD offer hifi-products supporting MQA and some smartphone makers like LG incorporated it too.\r\n\r\nMQA consists of a container format and a licensing regime for audio DACs.\r\n\r\nMQA files will play on any redbook-capable device and can be freely copied. The lowest bit of the file is used to store compressed spectral content above 24k and a control bit.\r\n\r\nIf a MQA licensed DAC detects an MQA file it will \u201cunfold\u201d the high-rez content and turn on a blue light on the DAC.\r\n\r\nA lot of effort for a switching on a blue light ;)\r\n\r\nThis talk will both scrutinize the DRM-regime of MQA and the sound-quality narrative. \r\n\r\nIn the context of the latter we will look at MQAs assertion that the Shannon-Nyquist theorem is inadequate for audio-sampling as it purportedly introduces \u201ctemporal inaccuracies.\u201d MQA claims to have incorporated \u201cnew psychoacoustic research\u201d and advances beyond Shannon-Nyquist in sampling theory. The exact nature of this innovations remain unclear as MQA technology is proprietary and no independent third-party research is available.\r\n\r\nWe will discuss these claims and show the status of the numerous MQA reverse-engineering efforts. So far it is know that MQA is PCM-based, uses minimum-phase filters and destructive compression for parts of the spectrum. It also lowers the available dynamic range and exhibits no behaviour proving any of their claims made in the marketing material. Still MQA at least managed to get the almost unequivocal support of the audio-press and at the same time is hotly debated online.\r\n\r\nWith regards to the DRM aspect we will look at the marketing strategy of MQA and show how the company so far successfully controlled the narrative by narrowing the understanding of DRM to copying. The MQA DRM uses a both symmetric encryption as well as a PKI-component to authenticate files and devices. The DRM involves a clever mix of permissive licensing towards behaviour like copying while discriminating access by level of quality.\r\n\r\nHere we will discuss in how far such licensing design might be a model for future DRM-deployments and marketing.\r\n\r\nFinally we will discuss the systemic dimension of MQA in the context of music-streaming and control over assets like content, playback-devices (DACs) and licenses. With the platforms controlling the streaming market and playback devices (iPhone, Amazon smart speakers etc) on the one side, the record companies owning the content on the other side, MQA seems to attempt to establish licensing leverage for the content owners.",

There are several people right now siting in jail that consider themselves anarchist or did actions that are supported by anarchist community. Not to let those people alone in prison we would like to have every day 1 hour around the table, where we get to know the stories of imprisoned activists and write them some words of support with postcards/letters.  You don't need any special skills for that. The postcards will be there for you.",
